# [‚è™ Understand Core Offerings](/README.md)

If we were at Disney Land then *Core Offerings* would be our directional
pillar.  You know those ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù things with a star helping
you see where you fit into it all. So where is your star on our
directional pillar? At the entrance?

## [‚è´ Support](#)

> Concepts: New Media, Yoga, SUP, Hike 

Support offerings are there to supplement the rest of your technical
learning. None of them are required for any reason other than this
supplemental learning. For example, a programmer does not need to have
a YouTube channel, blog, or Twitter account but understanding and
using them create a well rounded technologist and keeping up on the
latest developments.

Stand Up Paddleboarding, Yoga, and Hiking are things you can do to get
your mind off of code and maintain your health, which is particularly
challenging for those known to sit in front of screens hours at
a time. Keeping your mind fresh, fit, and clear creates an environment
where focus and creativity can thrive. You will have some of the best
breakthroughs of your life while doing physical activities that have
nothing to do with programming.

## [‚è´ Preparation](#)

Everyone starts in Prep. Prep classes are divided in three parts:

1. [Codecombat.com](/codecombat/README.md)
2. Prep Skill
3. Project Time

Prep skills prepare students to program like professionals introducing
them to pro tools in a fun way.

*Project Time* is for students to explore the different mini-projects
available or create their own as they imagine what they would like to
do with their skills and decide an initial focus for their learning.

The length of time in this course varies dramatically based on the
individual, their amount of time to focus on their preparation
skills, and their overall aptitude and motivation.  As soon as a
student can demonstrate they have mastered the *prep skills* they
can move on without waiting for the next course.

> üí¨ Unlike other schools we never make any student wait for any
> reason other than being prepared to move on. We also never move
> anyone on before they are ready even if it means repeating
> a course several times. Mastery is key.

## [‚è´ Proficiency](#)

> Concepts: Fundamentals, Projects, Learning Styles,
> Certification, Repetition, Mastery, Technology Path,
> Python, Web

Proficiency means being able to show that you are able to do
something, that you are competent. Getting to this point is what
*Proficiency* is all about. The greater your level of proficiency
the closer you get to mastery. There are two courses designed for the
two main types of learning styles.

### [‚è´ Fundamentals](#)

This course contains structured learning projects in sequence for those
who respond to more structure and who eventually may want to certify.
Each class group is divided into those wishing to follow the
*[Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io)* track and those who wish to
learn *[Web](http://webfun.skilstak.io)* technology.

Each 90 minute session is divided as follows:

1. 10 minutes: Homework Review and Personal Project Help
2. 20 minutes: Instruction from Lesson
3. 30 minutes: Mentored Class Work
4. 30 minutes: Mentor-Assisted Project Time

Students are generally expected to work outside of class on their
personal projects and CodeCombat levels. The first part of class
is to help you get over those parts that you were stuck on over the
week. You can also ask in the chat as well when you get stuck.
Sometimes having someone there just helps the most.

The next part is to present the lesson material for the day. Then,
after questions and answers, you break to work on the lesson for
yourself in your subgroup with your Mentor/TA.

The last part of class is *Project Time*, which is the same as that
from the *Projects* course.

These courses lead directly to [certification](http://certify.skilstak.io)
if followed.

### [‚è´ Projects](#)

> Concepts: Exploration, Specialization, Montessori-ish, Logging,
> Reporting

This course contains customized learning opportunities and lessons
designed for those who respond to less structure and desire more
independence.

Each 90 minute session is divided as follows:

1. 10 minutes: Personal Project Help
2. 20 minutes: Instruction from Customized Lesson
3. 50 minutes: Mentor-Assisted Project Time
4. 10 minutes: Reporting Time

Each class group is asked in advance specifically what they eventually
want to be able to do and lessons are designed specifically with
this goals in mind. Students are required to track their project work
in a weekly GitHub log repo where they can declare changes to their
project as well as their interests change. ***This report requirement
is not optional.***

Every class has a 20 minute lesson but it is optional for students
who may wish to put their headphones on and focus on their topic
and skills independently. Students from different *Projects* classes
may group informally with others working on similar goals.

This course promotes **exploration and specialization** more than
any other. Students may select one of the many project modules we
have available or declare and design their own. SkilStak provides
the resource support to help them complete their project in ways
that would not be possible alone (expensive software packages and
assets, hardware purchases, equipment, etc.).

Students can work on their [certification](http://certify.skilstak.io)
at their own pace or any number of other project including: 

* Other Languages: Go, Node, Java, C/C++, Assembly, Swift, Ruby, Perl
* Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, Certification
* Advanced Engineering with sensors, servos, solder and more
* Building computer clusters with Raspberry Pi
* LPIC Linux Professional Certification
* Retro Gameboy Pi
* Customized drones
* SolidWorks 3D modeling and printing
* 2D and 3D video games in Phaser, Unity and others
* Native Web apps with PhoneGap and React native
* Web APIs: Golang, Node
* Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaSQL
* Frontend frameworks: React, Redux, Angular, Ember
* OAUTH Authentication

### [‚è´ Proficiency Takes Time](#)

> –ü–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ ‚Äì –º–∞—Ç—å —É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è<br>
> Repetition is the mother of learning

All courses are designed to be repeated as many times as necessary.
This is not at all like most traditional education. You do not move
until you have attained mastery, measured by certification and
achievements.

Some may achieve proficiency in a month, others a year, others
longer.  There are a lot of things that are involved in how quickly
someone learns something. **The single biggest factor in learning
something is the amount of time practicing the activity.** This
means those who spend time outside of class working on stuff will
advance faster. The smallest factor is aptitude and intelligence.
Remember this. If you find yourself advancing more slowly than
someone else it is very unlikely it is because you are ‚Äúdumber‚Äù
than them. Instead you should look at how much time each day that
you are practicing and see if you can do more. It really is just
as simple as that. If you want to get good, you have to practice.
The sooner you learn that hard lesson the better.

## [‚è´ Professional](#)

> Concepts: Incubator, Industry Professionals, Tech Forums, 
> Tech Conferences, Giving Back, Community Involvement,
> Resumes, Recruiting, Unlimited Attendance, Financial Backing,
> Freelance Support, Client Work, Agile Management

### [‚è´ Incubator](#)

The [*Professional Incubator Program*][Pro] is for invite-only
students who have moved well beyond mastering programming and
demonstrated it well during *Fundamentals* or *Projects* classes.
These students are preparing to launch into higher education,
entrepreneurship, or working for an organization. In *Projects* you
built and explored stuff mostly for your own learning and curiosity,
in *Pro* you work on **stuff that benefits others**, a client, a
community, an organization. You are contributing, perhaps for free,
perhaps not.

### [‚è´ Invite Only](#)

<b>You must be invited into *Professional.*</b> To get an invite prepare
a proposal and submit it to your location manager. Your location
manager will review it with staff and decide to accept or not. If not
accepted there is always *Projects*.

### [‚è´ Projects SkilStak‚Ñ¢ Most Wants to See Built](#)

The main criteria for giving you an invite will be **how much your
manager personally wants to see your project completed** based on
the needs of your location, your local community, and abroad. Those
projects that provide the most value back to SkilStak and the local
community will almost always get invites provided you have the
fundamental skills to get started on it. Making a game would not
likely get an invite unless the game were educational or included
a tutorial about how to make it.

Projects that have been accepted include creating test prep software
for the public school system, working on open source projects,
creating a programming Summer camp curriculum, performing a security
analysis of an organization, writing a Slackbot to assist students,
and re-imaging laptops with Linux to use with afterschool programs.

### [‚è´ Higher Expectations](#)

It is important to understand that [expectations are different and
higher][expectations] for those at the *Professional* tier, and
that there are fewer spots available.

### [‚è´ Unlimited Access](#)

Pro carries the largest perk privilege of any offering: a free pass to
SkilStak anytime we are open and there is a seat. Not only do you come
on your time slot, but you can attend *any SkilStak course* with
advanced notice at any time for no extra cost. This is because once
approved we want to do everything in our power to help you succeed in
meeting your Pro project goals. This includes use of our lab, 3d
printer, AV equipment, tools, drawing tables, and special high-end
computers that might not be available to you otherwise.

> üí¨ This perk is also available to any student who has registered for
> more than one course during a given time period (ex: two Projects
> courses, or a Fundamentals and a Projects course in a single semester).
