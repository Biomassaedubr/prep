# [⏪ Understand Core Offerings](/README.md)

If we were at Disney Land then *Core Offerings* we be our directional
pillar.  You know those “you are here” things with a star helping
you see where you fit into it all. So where is your star on our
directional pillar? At the entrance?

Our offerings are divided into four levels or tiers:

1. Preparation
2. Proficiency
3. Project
4. Professional

Each has a general focus and different prices depending on the
location. (While we try to maintain our prices nationally we recognize
there are different costs of living depending on the location.)

## [⏫ Level 1: Preparation](#)

> Concepts: Code and Play, Play, Yoga, NewMedia

*Play*, *Prep*, *[Yoga][]*, and *[NewMedia][]* are all at
the *Preparation* level. Stuff here is designed to prepare and 
maintain your programming and other technical skills as you
build them. Before you ask, yes Yoga and YouTube are technical
skills. While *Yoga* and *NewMedia* are listed without connection
to anything they can be taken more than once, but are billed at the
*Preparation* tier. *Prep* and *Play* can also be taken more than once
but *Prep* is generally only needed for one semester (or less).

### Code and Play™

> Concepts: Code.org, Digital Recess, Camp

This offering is the least intimidating and the most affordable.
Designed particularly for younger students who have only been
familiar with a keyboard for a short time, students spent half the
time coding on [Code.org](http://code.org) and
[CodeCombat.com](http://codecombat.com). The second half of each
class is entirely dedicated to mini-projects and [*Digital
Recess*](http://recess.skilstak.io).

*Play* is held during the same time as *Prep* with the hope
being students will see what the *Prep* students are doing and
want to join in naturally helping them **progress from internal
motivation** in a non-threatening way. This also makes it 
convenient for families with young children of different ages 
that both want to attend at the same time.

## [⏫ Level 2: Proficiency](#)

Proficiency means being able to show that you are able to do
something, that you are competent, that you know the Fundamentals
well. The greater your level of proficiency the closer you get to
mastery. The two *Fundamentals* courses at this level are designed
to help you get proficient in coding, either in *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]* depending on which *[technology path][]* you've chosen.

This level is where things start getting more serious, but fun. Each
90 minute course is divided into three parts:

1. 15 minutes: Homework Review and Help (CodeCombat, etc.)
2. 20 minutes: Instruction from Lesson
3. 40 minutes: Class Work
4. 15 minutes: [Digital Recess][] / Fundamentals Projects

[Digital Recess]: https://github.com/skilstak/prep/blob/gh-pages/overview/README.md#user-content--digital-recess 
[technology path]: https://github.com/skilstak/prep/blob/gh-pages/path/README.md 
[Play]: http://play.skilstak.io

Students are generally expected to work outside of class primarily on
their CodeCombat levels. The first part of class is to help you get
over those parts that you were stuck on over the week. You can also
ask in the chat as well when you get stuck. Sometimes having someone
there just helps the most.

The next part is to present the lesson material for the day. Then,
after questions and answers, you break to work on the lesson for
yourself in your subgroup with your TA.

The last part of class is the same *Digital Recess* as Prep,
but less. You are also encouraged to do one of the *Fundamentals
Projects* instead.

> Повторение – мать учения<br>
> Repetition is the mother of learning

Some may achieve proficiency in a month, others a year, others
longer.  There are a lot of things that are involved in how quickly
someone learns something. **The single biggest factor in learning
something is the amount of time practicing the activity.** This
means those who spend time outside of class working on stuff will
advance faster. The smallest factor is aptitude and intelligence.
Remember this. If you find yourself advancing more slowly than
someone else it is very unlikely it is because you are “dumber”
than them. Instead you should look at how much time each day that
you are practicing and see if you can do more. It really is just
as simple as that. If you want to get good, you have to practice.
The sooner you learn that hard lesson the better.

### [⏫ Certified Mastery](#)

You don’t leave the *Proficiency* level until you [certify][]
that you have gained proficiency in either *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]*. Think martial arts v.s. public school. You can’t
earn a belt just because you changed grades. In fact, the more you
think about it, the more you will realize any organization that is
setup to advance students based on age and grade on a certain time
table is, well, flawed. Everyone is different.

## [⏫ Level 3: Project](#)

This level is for **exploration and specialization**.  Montessori
has championed the idea that projects foster independence,
accountability, internal drive, and ownership of one’s own learning.
In that sense we agree a lot with the approach.

We have prepared learning modules (projects) for different *main
focus categories* and are constantly adding more. We also encourage
you to explore things by creating your own learning projects with
the help of your mentor/instructor. Each project will have its own
GitHub Classroom repo to archive and refer back to as well as a
listing in your [SkilStak IDP](http://idp.skilstak.io).

Project level courses can be taken repeatedly. Usually you will see
*Projects* on the weekly schedule when signing up. Sometimes you
will see one of the *main focus categories* instead (*Engineering*,
*Linux*, *Languages*, *Data*, *Apps*, *Game*). Students may register
for more than one time during the week and usually there is one day
during the week with two *Projects* slots back to back creating a
3-hour block for those that want to sign up for both.

### [⏫ Main Focus Categories](#)

Currently there are five categories, each with a
[certification](http://certify.skilstak.io) prerequisite. Read more
details about each by following the links:

1. [Python][] -> [Engineering][]
1. [Python][] -> [Linux][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Languages][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Data][]
1. [Web][] -> [Apps][]
1. [Web][]  -> [Game][]

[Yoga]: http://yoga.skilstak.io
[NewMedia]: http://newmedia.skilstak.io
[Web]: http://webfun.skilstak.io
[Python]: http://pyfun.skilstak.io
[Engineering]: http://eng.skilstak.io
[Linux]: http://linux.skilstak.io
[Languages]: http://lang.skilstak.io
[Apps]: http://apps.skilstak.io
[Game]: http://game.skilstak.io
[Data]: http://data.skilstak.io
[certify]: http://certify.skilstak.io

Please don't confuse *main focus categories* with a course although
often students with a common focus category will be grouped together
in a *Projects* class for convenience. Sometimes one *Projects*
time will be dedicated to just one category and appear with that
category name on the schedule.

### [⏫ Custom Projects](#)

In addition to the *main focus categories* we encouraged students
to come up with their own, (with the help of their mentor/instructor).
For example:

* Other Languages: Go, Node, Java, C/C++, Assembly, Swift, Ruby, Perl
* Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, Certification
* Advanced Engineering with sensors, servos, solder and more
* Building computer clusters with Raspberry Pi
* LPIC Linux Professional Certification
* Retro Gameboy Pi
* Customized drones
* SolidWorks 3D modeling and printing
* 2D and 3D video games in Phaser, Unity and others
* Native Web apps with PhoneGap and React native
* Web APIs: Golang, Node
* Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaSQL
* Frontend frameworks: React, Redux, Angular, Ember
* OAUTH Authentication

One or more semesters of *Projects* courses prepares you well with
stuff to show off in your GitHub repo so the world knows you have
really solidify your mastery of programming and your specialization.
Eventually you might want to pitch one or more of your current or
future projects for the *Professional Incubator Program*.

## [⏫ Level 4: Professionals](#)

Currently there is only one course at this level: [*Professional Incubator
Program*][Pro]. 

The *Professional* level is for students who have mastered programming
and demonstrated it well during *Projects* classes and now need to
launch into higher education, entrepreneurship, or working for an
organization. In *Projects* you built and explored stuff mostly for
your own learning and curiosity, in *Pro* you work on **stuff that
benefits others**, a client, a community, an organization. You are
contributing, perhaps for free, perhaps not.

<b>You must be invited into *Professional.*</b> To get an invite prepare
a proposal and submit it to your location manager. Your location
manager will review it with staff and decide to accept or not. If not
accepted there is always *Projects*.

The main criteria for giving you an invite will be **how much your
manager personally wants to see your project completed** based on
the needs of your location, your local community, and abroad. Those
projects that provide the most value back to SkilStak and the local
community will almost always get invites provided you have the
fundamental skills to get started on it. Making a game would not
likely get an invite unless the game were educational or included
a tutorial about how to make it.

Projects that have been accepted include creating test prep software
for the public school system, working on open source projects,
creating a programming Summer camp curriculum, performing a security
analysis of an organization, writing a Slackbot to assist students,
and re-imaging laptops with Linux to use with afterschool programs.

It is important to understand that [expectations are different and
higher][expectations] for those at the *Professional* tier, and
that there are fewer spots available.

Pro carries the largest perk privilege of any offering: a free pass to
SkilStak anytime we are open and there is a seat. Not only do you come
on your time slot, but you can attend *any SkilStak course* with
advanced notice at any time for no extra cost. This is because once
approved we want to do everything in our power to help you succeed in
meeting your Pro project goals. This includes use of our lab, 3d
printer, AV equipment, tools, drawing tables, and special high-end
computers that might not be available to you otherwise.
