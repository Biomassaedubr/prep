## [‚è´ Level 1: Preparation](#)

> Concepts: Play, Prep, Yoga, NewMedia, Code.org, 
> CodeCombat.com, Digital Recess, Gentle Introduction

*Play*, *Prep*, *[Yoga][]*, and *[NewMedia][]* are all at
the *Preparation* level. Stuff here is designed to prepare and 
maintain your programming and other technical skills as you
build them. 

### [‚è´ Code and Play‚Ñ¢](#)

This offering is the least intimidating and the most affordable.
Designed particularly for younger students who have only been
familiar with a keyboard for a short time, students spent half the
time coding on [Code.org](http://code.org) and
[CodeCombat.com](http://codecombat.com). The second half of each
class is entirely dedicated to mini-projects and [*Digital
Recess*](http://recess.skilstak.io).

> ‚õî The primary challenge for this group is learning to remember an
> email address and password (provided to them by their parents).

### [‚è´ Code and Prep‚Ñ¢](#)

> üí¨ This offerings page is itself a part of the 
> *[Prep Textbook](/README.md)*

This is the first course everyone takes. Anyone can enter *Prep* at
any time and the cost is prorated for the remaining classes in the
semester.

Students stay in *Prep* as long as then need and want. When they
have completed the *Prep Skills* they can immediately move to
*Fundamentals*.

> üí¨ Unlike other schools we never make any student wait for any
> reason other than being prepared to move on. We also never move
> anyone on before they are ready even if it means repeating
> a course several times. Mastery is key.

### [‚è´ Yoga](#)

This course can be taken at any time and has no prerequisites.
The cost is significantly subsidized making it only available
to current students enrolled in other courses. Often this will
be the most affordable Yoga offering in the region and we
wish to maintain a healthy relationship with other dedicated
Yoga studios in the area, even though we generally rent or
partner with them to provide our own Yoga course.

Before you ask, yes Yoga is a technical skill, which is discussed
more in the [SkilStak‚Ñ¢ Yoga textbook][Yoga].

### [‚è´ New Media](#)

This course can be taken at any time and has no prerequisites.

The name represents all the new media used by technologist to maintain
their personal learning networks and connect with others. It includes
self publishing on YouTube and blogs and social media. 

Read more in the *[NewMedia textbook][NewMedia]*

## [‚è´ Level 2: Proficiency](#)

> Concepts: Fundamentals, Certification, Repetition,
> Mastery, Technology Path, Python, Web, Digital Recess

Proficiency means being able to show that you are able to do
something, that you are competent, that you know the Fundamentals
well. The greater your level of proficiency the closer you get to
mastery. The two *Fundamentals* courses at this level are designed
to help you get proficient in coding, either in *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]* depending on which *[technology path][]* you've chosen.

### [‚è´ Fundamentals](#)

There are two courses at the *Proficiency* level:

1. [Fundamentals in Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io)
2. [Fundamentals in Web](http://webfun.skilstak.io)

This level is where things start getting more serious, but fun. Each
90 minute course is divided into three parts:

1. 15 minutes: Homework Review and Help (CodeCombat, etc.)
2. 20 minutes: Instruction from Lesson
3. 40 minutes: Class Work
4. 15 minutes: [Digital Recess][] / Fundamentals Projects

[Digital Recess]: http://recess.skilstak.io
[technology path]: http://path.skilstak.io

Students are generally expected to work outside of class primarily on
their CodeCombat levels. The first part of class is to help you get
over those parts that you were stuck on over the week. You can also
ask in the chat as well when you get stuck. Sometimes having someone
there just helps the most.

The next part is to present the lesson material for the day. Then,
after questions and answers, you break to work on the lesson for
yourself in your subgroup with your TA.

The last part of class is the same *[Digital Recess][]* as Prep,
but less. You are also encouraged to do one of the *Fundamentals
Projects* instead.

> Repetition is the mother of learning

Some may achieve proficiency in a month, others a year, others
longer.  There are a lot of things that are involved in how quickly
someone learns something. **The single biggest factor in learning
something is the amount of time practicing the activity.** This
means those who spend time outside of class working on stuff will
advance faster. The smallest factor is aptitude and intelligence.
Remember this. If you find yourself advancing more slowly than
someone else it is very unlikely it is because you are ‚Äúdumber‚Äù
than them. Instead you should look at how much time each day that
you are practicing and see if you can do more. It really is just
as simple as that. If you want to get good, you have to practice.
The sooner you learn that hard lesson the better.

### [‚è´ Certified Mastery](#)

You don‚Äôt leave the *Proficiency* level until you [certify][]
that you have gained proficiency in either *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]*. Think martial arts v.s. public school. You can‚Äôt
earn a belt just because you changed grades. In fact, the more you
think about it, the more you will realize any organization that is
setup to advance students based on age and grade on a certain time
table is, well, flawed. Everyone is different.

## [‚è´ Level 3: Projects](#)

> Concepts: Exploration, Specialization, Montessori-ish, Textbooks,
> Workbooks, Focus Categories, Logging, Reporting, IDP,
> Data, Apps, Game, Languages, Linux, Engineering, Custom Projects

This level is for **exploration and specialization**.  Montessori
has championed the idea that projects foster independence,
accountability, internal drive, and ownership of one‚Äôs own learning.
In that sense we agree a lot with the approach.

We have prepared several project textbook/workbook combinations for
the different *focus categories* and cataloged them for browsing
and searching are constantly adding more. We also encourage you to
explore things by creating and cataloging your own projects with
the help of your mentor/instructor. Each project will have its own
GitHub Classroom repo to archive and refer back to as well as a
listing in your [SkilStak IDP](http://idp.skilstak.io).

Students in *Projects* are required to log and report all the work they
do in their GitHub workbooks.

The *Projects* course can be taken repeatedly. Usually you will see
*Projects* on the weekly schedule when signing up. Sometimes you
will see one of the *focus categories* instead (*Engineering*,
*Linux*, *Languages*, *Data*, *Apps*, *Game*). Students may register
for more than one time during the week and usually there is one day
during the week with two *Projects* slots back to back creating a
3-hour block for those that want to sign up for both.

### [‚è´ Focus Categories](#)

Currently there are five categories, each with a
[certification](http://certify.skilstak.io) prerequisite. Read more
details about each by following the links:

1. [Python][] -> [Engineering][]
1. [Python][] -> [Linux][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Languages][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Data][]
1. [Web][] -> [Apps][]
1. [Web][]  -> [Game][]

[Yoga]: http://yoga.skilstak.io
[NewMedia]: http://newmedia.skilstak.io
[Web]: http://webfun.skilstak.io
[Python]: http://pyfun.skilstak.io
[Engineering]: http://eng.skilstak.io
[Linux]: http://linux.skilstak.io
[Languages]: http://lang.skilstak.io
[Apps]: http://apps.skilstak.io
[Game]: http://game.skilstak.io
[Data]: http://data.skilstak.io
[certify]: http://certify.skilstak.io

Please don't confuse *focus categories* with a course although
often students with a common focus category will be grouped together
in a *Projects* class for convenience. Sometimes one *Projects*
time will be dedicated to just one category and appear with that
category name on the schedule.

### [‚è´ Custom Projects](#)

In addition to the *focus categories* we encouraged students
to come up with their own, (with the help of their mentor/instructor).
For example:

* Other Languages: Go, Node, Java, C/C++, Assembly, Swift, Ruby, Perl
* Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, Certification
* Advanced Engineering with sensors, servos, solder and more
* Building computer clusters with Raspberry Pi
* LPIC Linux Professional Certification
* Retro Gameboy Pi
* Customized drones
* SolidWorks 3D modeling and printing
* 2D and 3D video games in Phaser, Unity and others
* Native Web apps with PhoneGap and React native
* Web APIs: Golang, Node
* Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaSQL
* Frontend frameworks: React, Redux, Angular, Ember
* OAUTH Authentication

One or more semesters of *Projects* courses prepares you well with
stuff to show off in your GitHub repo so the world knows you have
really solidify your mastery of programming and your specialization.
Eventually you might want to pitch one or more of your current or
future projects for the *Professional Incubator Program*.

## [‚è´ Level 4: Professionals](#)

> Concepts: Incubator, Industry Professionals, Tech Forums, 
> Tech Conferences, Giving Back, Community Involvement,
> Resumes, Recruiting, Unlimited Attendance, Financial Backing,
> Freelance Support, Client Work, Agile Management

### [‚è´ Incubator](#)

The [*Professional Incubator Program*][Pro] is for invite-only
students who have moved well beyond mastering programming and
demonstrated it well during *Projects* classes. These students are
preparing to launch into higher education, entrepreneurship, or
working for an organization. In *Projects* you built and explored
stuff mostly for your own learning and curiosity, in *Pro* you work
on **stuff that benefits others**, a client, a community, an
organization. You are contributing, perhaps for free, perhaps not.

### [‚è´ Invite Only](#)

<b>You must be invited into *Professional.*</b> To get an invite prepare
a proposal and submit it to your location manager. Your location
manager will review it with staff and decide to accept or not. If not
accepted there is always *Projects*.

### [‚è´ Projects SkilStak‚Ñ¢ Most Wants to See Built](#)

The main criteria for giving you an invite will be **how much your
manager personally wants to see your project completed** based on
the needs of your location, your local community, and abroad. Those
projects that provide the most value back to SkilStak and the local
community will almost always get invites provided you have the
fundamental skills to get started on it. Making a game would not
likely get an invite unless the game were educational or included
a tutorial about how to make it.

Projects that have been accepted include creating test prep software
for the public school system, working on open source projects,
creating a programming Summer camp curriculum, performing a security
analysis of an organization, writing a Slackbot to assist students,
and re-imaging laptops with Linux to use with afterschool programs.

### [‚è´ Higher Expectations](#)

It is important to understand that [expectations are different and
higher][expectations] for those at the *Professional* tier, and
that there are fewer spots available.

### [‚è´ Unlimited Access](#)

Pro carries the largest perk privilege of any offering: a free pass to
SkilStak anytime we are open and there is a seat. Not only do you come
on your time slot, but you can attend *any SkilStak course* with
advanced notice at any time for no extra cost. This is because once
approved we want to do everything in our power to help you succeed in
meeting your Pro project goals. This includes use of our lab, 3d
printer, AV equipment, tools, drawing tables, and special high-end
computers that might not be available to you otherwise.
