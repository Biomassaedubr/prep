# [‚è™ Create CodeCombat.com Account(s)](/README.md)

Welcome to CodeCombat, the most fun we have found to learn
programming online. Let's create an account, or two.

> üí¨ We are shocked that
> CodeCombat has actually been banned in some public schools because,
> and I quote, ‚ÄúIt is a game.‚Äù These same schools promote code.org,
> (which is not real programming), and codeacademy, (which is full of
> job-stopping bugs and incorrect syntax, which have been reported
> and remain after seven years). Here are some more reasons we
> *love* CodeCombat and think it is really the best online learning
> resource for programming available to students ages eight and up.
> 
> **Open Source:** The source of [CodeCombat is completely open
> and available][open] for anyone to use or modify as they wish. This
> is a major reason we use CodeCombat. Everything we do is completely
> available for free and we feel strongly in supporting those that
> feel the same way whether it be CodeCombat, [FreeCodeCamp][], or
> [MIT][].
>
> **Responsive Team of Developers:** The team behind CodeCombat is
> amazing and available pretty much constantly via their [public
> developer chat channels][chat]. If you think you have found a bug
> jump into the chat room and let them know.  They'll appreciate it.
> In fact, the developers and architects are often available for a
> phone conversation to discuss ways to make CoCo even better. This
> is unfortunately a rare thing when it comes to a lot of educational
> offerings out there.

## Create Two Accounts

When you [picked your primary technology path](#-pick-a-path), you also
picked the main language you will learn in CodeCombat, Python or
JavaScript (Web). You should go ahead and create accounts for both
languages right just both are there when you want them. If you are
dedicated you can actually do them both. 

Avoid the temptation to create a Google+ account because that requires
you to be logged into Google from that browser, which prevents you
from easily switching between the different languages.

## Repeat

Now that you have completed the steps to signup for one account,
say `+py`, do them again for an account for the other language, say
`+js`. One will be your primary account, but having them both let's
you work on both if you have extra time or want to work on more at
home.
