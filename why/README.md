> Concepts: Code.org, Why Code?, Hour of Code, Coding

You are here to learn to code, but why? Why code? Sure it seems fun,
but what can you do with it? Let‚Äôs start with this video from
[code.org](http://code.org), an internationally recognized non-profit
promoting coding everywhere. There is a good chance you know about
them already from something you may have done in school, such as their
Hour of Code. 

> üí¨ We do much, much more than an hour of code once a year as promoted
> by code.org to get people to try it, more like *hours* of code, if
> not *days* of code.

This video is little a cheesy but explains why ‚Äúcoding‚Äù matters and why
you should learn it.
