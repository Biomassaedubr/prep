# [⏪ Complete the Markdown Tutorial](/README.md)

All your workbook work and most of your code documentation will be
written in Markdown, a very basic language for adding things to text.
Complete the [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com) online.

Markdown is an important language that almost does not seem like
a language. It is designed to look just like what you would type in
text if you wanted to emphasize something or create a link to another
web page. **All of this [SkilStak™ GitHub Textbook][t] is written in
Markdown.** You may not know it yet, but many sites allow Markdown to
be used wherever text is allowed.
