## [‚è´ Why Code?](#)

> Concepts: Code.org, Why Code?, Hour of Code, Coding

You are here to learn to code, but why? Why code? Sure it seems fun,
but what can you do with it? Let‚Äôs start with this video from
[code.org](http://code.org), an internationally recognized non-profit
promoting coding everywhere. There is a good chance you know about
them already from something you may have done in school, such as their
Hour of Code. 

> üí¨ We do much, much more than an hour of code once a year as promoted
> by code.org to get people to try it, more like *hours* of code, if
> not *days* of code.

This video is little a cheesy but explains why ‚Äúcoding‚Äù matters and why
you should learn it.

## [‚è´ What is Prep?](#)

> Concepts: Class Format, Semester, Weekly Schedule

Prep is one of five main technology courses offered at SkilStak‚Ñ¢.
Normally classes meet for 90 minutes once a week for 16 weeks, or
one full ***semester***. Each 90-minute class is divided into three
parts:

1. **30 minutes:** [CodeCombat](#codecombat)
2. **45 minutes:** [Prep Skills](#prep-skills) or [Prep
   Projects](#prep-projects)
3. **15 minutes:** [Digital Recess](#digital-recess)

> üí¨ Sometimes this exact amount of time and order is modified
> depending on the class‚Äîespecially if you are in a Prep course that
> is not at a SkilStak‚Ñ¢ location.

The [Prep Skills](#prep-skills) directly prepare you to
continue on to [Fundamentals in Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io)
or [Fundamentals in Web](http://webfun.skilstak.io) then on to
[Project](http://project.skilstak.io) and eventually
[Pro](http://pro.skilstak.io). Read more in *[Understanding Core
Offerings](http://offerings.skilstak.io)*.

> üçé The name *Prep* implies there is less coding happening, which is
> true, but we do code in this course, just in a more controlled and
> fun way before moving on to the more serious, challenging material
> in *Fundamentals*.

## [‚è´ CodeCombat](#)

> Concepts: CodeCombat.com, Computational Thinking, Real Programming,
> Ignorance in Educational Institutions

[CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com) is a game where you basically
program a bot, your hero, to complete challenges in a fun, graphic
environment.  

> üí¨ Ironically CodeCombat has been forbidden by some schools as ‚Äúa game‚Äù
> (no I am not kidding). It is almost as if some educators refuse to
> allow learning to be fun. Well that ain‚Äôt us. 

CodeCombat.com is crazy fun‚Äîbut more importantly‚Äîit‚Äôs *real*
programming. This is no simple game. Do as much CodeCombat as you
can during class and outside of class. Those who work the most on
it outside of class tend to progress the fastest. The first part
of every class is dedicated to helping you through CodeCombat.

> üí¨üçé For some reason when traditional educators get a hold of something

## [‚è´ Prep Skills](#)

> Concepts: Prep Skills, Mastery, Advancement

Prep skills will serve you well outside of SkilStak‚Ñ¢. Some of them
are to prepare you for our rather unique way of learning‚Äîby doing
what the pros do. It is more than a little ironic that the most
sensible way of learning employable skills is still considered rare
these days.  (For example, GitHub is still banned in several school
districts while corporate educational products are forced on students
that will have no lasting value outside of their school.)

Like everything here, you only have to stay in something long enough
to prove you know it to move on, no waiting around for the next
semester, even the next week. You move immediately when you want to
and you can prove you are ready.

## [‚è´ Prep Projects](#)

> Concepts: Prep Projects, Project Based Learning

As soon as you have completed the Prep skills and recorded your
results in your workbook you can move on‚Äîimmediately. Or, you can
stay in Prep and continue to work on ***Prep Projects***, mini-projects
that promote a desire for coding without getting really into coding
itself. For example, we create the art for and assemble several
video games for the web and practice connecting remotely to another
computer by ‚Äúhacking‚Äù other consenting students and making their
computers speak.

## [‚è´ Digital Recess](#)

> Concepts: Digital Recess, Netiquette, Social Skills, Minecraft,
> Agar.io, Class Progress Review

> üçé Digital recess is omitted from 60-minute classes and many on-site
> school programs where there is ample opportunity for *real* recess.

*Digital Recess* is a term we came up with after watching students
look forward to the ‚Äúfree‚Äù time they have together to play on their
classroom computers together. Whether it be collaboratively building
in a Minecraft world, trying not to get gobbled up by their neighbor
in Agar.io, or working on mini-projects solo or together, this time
has become important not only to the students but to instructors.
What appears to just be play time, is exactly that, just play
time‚Äîbut together.

Students often have a lot of opportunity to play games at home,
alone. But digital recess gives them an opportunity to realize the
person they are playing the game with is **a person** sitting right
next to them. The importance of this lesson cannot be
overstated‚Äîespecially today.

Social skills, managing conflict and failure, and basic human
interaction actually happen because they are in the room with the
person they are playing with. Is this as good as running
around outside on the playground? Yes, but in a different way. This
helps reinforce *netiquette* by unconsciously reinforcing that the
avatar they are playing with has a person behind it, and in this
case, that person is sitting in the same room. Too often online
gaming is not the problem, it is the removal of that other person's
humanity by covering it up with an anonymous avatar. Digital recess
helps combat this in a fun way.

For instructors and teacher assistants this bit of time at the end
of class provides a moment to review the class together, provide
feedback, [pay staff rebates][rebates], and sometimes meet with a parent or
two briefly.
