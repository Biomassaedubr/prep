We welcome everyone to SkilStak‚Ñ¢ from all backgrounds and abilities.
In fact, often those that think coding might not be for them end up
the best coders of all. 

However, in order to ensure the best experience for everyone we
need to make sure only motivated, capable students are admitted in
the first place. This is not the same as a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù student,
just the distinction between those who meet the following and those
that don‚Äôt:

1. Want to learn
2. Able to use the basic tools we use
3. Willing and able to contribute to the learning of others

## [‚è´ Am I Ready?](#)

> Concepts: Minimum Requirements, Maturity, Level of Understanding,
> Motor Skills

One of the first questions everyone asks‚Äîparticularly from those
who have less technical background‚Äîis can they do it; can they code;
are they ready for SkilStak‚Ñ¢?

Mostly it depends on the level of interest and motivation in the
student, how willing they are to work hard and stick with it. **It
has almost nothing to do with how smart a person is.**

> üí¨ ‚ÄúGrit trumps talent,‚Äù as one [Wall Street Journal][] notes.
[Wall Street Journal]: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304213904579095303368899132

There are, however, some minimum requirements. If these requirements
are not met, or for some reason a student fails to meet them later,
then it is in everyone‚Äôs best interest to have that student stop
attending. This is why we do an initial evaluation‚Äîincluding a
basic assessment test‚Äîbefore admitting *any* student.

### [‚è´ Primary Requirements for Enrollment](#)

> ‚õî We have students as young as seven attending and learning
> productively but **SkilStak‚Ñ¢ is not a daycare.** 

1. Willing and able to read
2. Willing and able to type 10 wpm (24 for Fundamentals)
3. Willing and able to remember passwords
4. Willing to do work in class and not distract others
5. Not monopolize the attention of the instructor or TA
6. Can do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   with remainders

The hardest of these for most is remembering passwords and the math.

Any password strategy a parent and student can come up with works
including sending the student to class every week with a new paper
with their printed passwords on it.

> üçé At admission every student should be given a card or print out
> with every account URL, account email name used, and initial unique
> password.


### Math Requirement

As for the math, well, unfortunately our public education system
is woefully bad at bringing most students to even a fundamental
[mastery](/mastery/README.md) of basic math no matter what the
method of the day seems to be popular. While we have no professional
or personal connection, we strongly recommend
[Mathnasium](http://www.mathnasium.com) or
[KhanAcademy.com](http://khanacademy.com) to help bring potential
students math levels up to our minimums. Mathnasium costs are
reasonable considering the unlimited amount of attendance during
a given month. Khanacademy.com, of course, is free.

> ‚õî **Unfortunately, for the sake
> of other students, we cannot accept students who do not meet our
> minimum math requirements under any circumstances and have no plans to
> add math instruction to our curriculum.**

## [‚è´ Basic Admission Test](#)

> Concepts: 15 Minute Admission Test, Passwords,
> Reading Comprehension, Basic Math, Free Audit

When considering SkilStak‚Ñ¢ part of the process is for the potential
student to attend *Prep* and possibly also *Fundamentals* for free
to audit it. During a portion of the class time the potential student
is given an assessment test to be completed strictly within 15
minutes.

While the exact content of every exam will differ slightly for every
student the format and general areas will be the same. They are as
follows:

1. Read a paragraph on a web page and answer questions about it
2. Write 2-3 sentences describing why the student wants to attend
3. Answer 2-3 math problems including remainders and 0-12 times tables 

This all happens during the 15 minutes that the student is on site
at SkilStak‚Ñ¢. The location manager, who is essentially the principal
of the school, will personally review the results and make the
decision that same day before you leave. He or she can then discuss
the options including referring a personal tutor from among senior
student teachers and teacher assistants if the exam reveals the
candidate is not yet ready for admission.

> ‚õî Parents will not be allowed to help with any part of the
> exam including logging the potential student into Gmail. Parents
> must remain in another room or off site during the exam. ***All
> preparations for the exam must be completed before arriving
> at SkilStak‚Ñ¢***.

### [‚è´ Reading Comprehension](#)

The test questions will include reading comprehension by going to
a web site and reading the material and responding by typed responses.
(ex: Go to skilstak.io and read enough to answer this question: how
many students are generally assigned to a single teacher assistant?)

### [‚è´ Self Expression, Basic Typed Communication](#)

This is a general question usually related to the student‚Äôs goals,
desires, and opinions to check the candidate‚Äôs ability to minimally
compose their thoughts and communicate them through typed email
responses. Students throughout all the courses are expected to log
their progress and express themselves in this way. (ex: In a few
sentences describe what it is that you like about SkilStak‚Ñ¢ and what
you intend to do eventually with your new coding powers?)

### [‚è´ Basic Math](#)

The test will also include one or more basic math questions involving
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, basic decimals
and simple graphing coordinates. (ex: What is 5 divided by 2?)

### [‚è´ Strictly Timed](#)

One main purpose of this exam is to ensure students can perform the
basics that other students are expected to know in about the same
time frame as them. This means those candidates with slow typing
speeds (< 10 wpm), undeveloped motor skills, or reading comprehension
impairments will likely not complete within the allotted time.

### [‚è´ Unlimited Attempts, Fee Required](#)

The first audit and admission exam is free. However, candidates can
take the exam as many times as they like for a $50 fee for each
attempt.

### [‚è´ Tutoring](#)

Many of our amazing teacher assistants or senior student teachers
are available for private tutoring at the home or site of the
student. For those who are not able to pass the admissions exam
this option can be considered by parents and students until they
can pass.

## [‚è´ No Age Limit](#)

While our custom course material is designed for those generally from
eight to eighteen *anyone* of *any* age can seek admission.

## [‚è´ Fees](#)

> Concept: Fees, Registration Costs, Late Registration

### [‚è´ One-Time Admission Fee](#)

All first-time students who are under 13 are automatically assessed
a $50 admission fee to cover the cost of the following work:

1. Adding parents to [mailing list](http://mailing.skilstak.io)
1. Creating student‚Äôs [SkilStak‚Ñ¢ Gmail aliases](http://gmail.skilstak.io)
1. Adding student to [Slack chat room](http://slack.skilstak.io)
1. Creating [CodeCombat accounts](http://coco.skilstak.io)
1. Creating a [GitHub account](http://github.skilstak.io)
1. Creating a [`skilstak.sh`](http://cli.skilstak.io) account
1. Configuring [GitHub keys](http://keys.skilstak.io)

Those students 13 and up have the option of waving this fee and doing
these things themselves with their parents at home either before or
during their Prep course. Otherwise, they can pay the admission fee
to save themselves the extra work.

### [‚è´ Late Registration](#)

There *is* also a $50 fee for ***late*** registration every semester.
This is waved for first-time students entering at any time during
the semester.

## [‚è´ Register Anytime](#)

> Concepts: First Time Registration, All Start in Prep

New students can register and enroll anytime during the year or
semester. *Everyone* starts in *Prep* and the cost is prorated over
the remaining class dates in the semester. However, motivated
students can complete the requirements and verify their *Prep*
skills allowing them to move to *Fundamentals* any time during the
semester‚Äîparticularly if in the first half of the semester.
