# [⏪ Admission](/README.md)

We welcome everyone to SkilStak™ from all backgrounds and abilities.
In fact, often those that think coding might not be for them end up
the best coders of all. 

However, in order to ensure the best experience for everyone we
need to make sure only motivated, capable students are admitted in
the first place. This is not the same as a “good” or “bad” student,
just the distinction between those who meet the following and those
that don’t:

1. Want to learn
2. Able to use the basic tools we use
3. Willing and able to contribute to the learning of others

## [⏫ Am I Ready?](#)

> Concepts: Minimum Requirements, Maturity, Level of Understanding,
> Motor Skills

One of the first questions everyone asks—particularly from those
who have less technical background—is can they do it; can they code;
are they ready for SkilStak™?

The answer is **it depends.** Mostly it depends on the level of
interest and motivation in the student, how willing they are to
work hard and stick with it. **It has almost nothing to do
with how smart a person is.**

There are, however, some minimum requirements. If these requirements
are not met, or for some reason a student fails to meet them later,
then it is in everyone’s best interest to have that student stop
attending. This is why we do an initial evaluation—including a
basic assessment test—before admitting *any* student.

### [⏫ Primary Requirements for Enrollment](#)

1. Willing and able to read
2. Willing and able to type 10 wpm (24 for Fundamentals)
3. Willing and able to remember passwords and use email effectively
4. Willing to do work in class and not distract others
5. Not monopolize the attention of the instructor or TA
6. Can do basic addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
   fractions, and decimals

> ⛔ We have students as young as seven attending and learning
> productively but **SkilStak™ is not a daycare.** 

## [⏫ Basic Admission Test](#)

When considering SkilStak™ part of the process is for the potential
student to attend *Prep* and possibly also *Fundamentals* for free
to audit it. During a portion of the class time the potential student
is given an assessment test to be completed strictly within 15
minutes.

While the exact content of every exam will differ slightly for every
student the format and general areas will be the same. They are as
follows:

1. Login to Gmail
2. Send email to your SkilStak™ location’s email address asking for
   the test
3. Receive the response email containing the test questions
4. Complete the answers to the test questions in the email
5. Send the completed test as an email response back

This all happens during the 15 minutes that the student is on site
at SkilStak™. 

> ⛔ Parents will not be allowed to help with any part of the
exam including logging the potential student into Gmail.

### [⏫ Reading Comprehension](#)

The test questions will include reading comprehension by going to
a web site and reading the material and responding by typed responses.

### [⏫ Basic Math](#)

The test will also include several basic math questions involving
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals
and simple graphing coordinates.

### [⏫ Strictly Timed](#)

One main purpose of this exam is to ensure students can perform the
basics that other students are expected to know in about the same
time frame as them. This means those candidates with slow typing
speeds (< 10 wpm), undeveloped motor skills, or reading comprehension
impairments will likely not complete within the allotted time.

### [⏫ Unlimited Attempts, Fee Required](#)

The first audit and admission exam is free. However, candidates can
take the exam as many times as they like for a $50 fee for each
attempt.

### [⏫ Tutoring](#)

Many of our amazing teacher assistants or senior student teachers
are available for private tutoring at the home or site of the
student. For those who are not able to pass the admissions exam
this option can be considered by parents and students until they
can pass.

## [⏫ No Age Limit](#)

While our custom course material is designed for those generally from
eight to eighteen *anyone* of *any* age can seek admission.

## [⏫ No Admission or Registration Fee](#)

Unlike other programs there is no fee for the initial audit and any
enrollment or registration, only the cost of the course.

> ⛔ However, there *is* a $50 fee for ***late*** registration every
> semester. This is waved for first-time students entering at
> any time during the semester.

## [⏫ Register Anytime](#)

New students can register and enroll anytime during the year or
semester. *Everyone* starts in *Prep* and the cost is prorated over
the remaining class dates in the semester. However, motivated
students can complete the requirements and verify their *Prep*
skills allowing them to move to *Fundamentals* any time during the
semester—particularly if in the first half of the semester.
