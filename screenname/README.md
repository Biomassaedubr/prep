# [⏪ Pick a Screen Name](/README.md)

A screen name is a name to use on the screen that usually does not
give away your real name, but some people include some part of their
real name in it. That is up to you (and your parents). *Your screen
name will be known to the public.*

## [⏫ Handling Duplicates](#)

Often your name will already be taken. Most will just add a number
after their name until they find one that is unique. If you have
had SkilStak™ register for you then you may have such a name for
GitHub or CodeCombat if your screen name is common. For example,
`mudkip` -> `mudkip1`.
