# [⏪ Pick a Screen Name](/README.md)

> 🍎 All SkilStak™ participants need a screen name including those
> enrolled in semester courses, workshops, on-site school programs,
> and one-time camps.

A screen name is a name to use on the screen that usually does not
give away your real name, but some people include some part of their
real name in it. That is up to you (and your parents). *Your screen
name will be known to the public.*

## [⏫ Anonymous If You Wish](#)

Many will create a screen name that does not give any information
about you in the name itself. `smokiemario`, `l33thacks`, `robmuh` are
examples of different screen names that keep your information
anonymous. You can certain include your name if you wish (and your
parents approve). **Remember that your screen name will be publically
associated with any projects you put on GitHub as well as your
SkilStak™ achievements and profile.** All of these things can be
disabled at your request if you wish all your SkilStak™ work to remain
completely anonymous.

> 💬 SkilStak™ will never require that you put anything onto the
> Internet including any GitHub repos. Your workbook repos are private
> and only seen by you and your location manager and SkilStak™ staff.
> Not even your parents can see your workbook repos without you
> showing it to them, which we expect you will do when asked.
>
> 💬 Eventually, after you are 13 at least, we encourage you to
> associate your full name with your GitHub repo since potential
> employers and colleges often search GitHub for candidates. Even then
> only the projects you choose to make public will be there because
> all SkilStak™ work will be in private repos.

## [⏫ All Lowercase](#)

Because your screen name will be used for your `skilstak.sh` login,
email, and more you want to pick a lowercase name. This also avoids
having things go wrong with your web site when you create it on
GitHub.

## [⏫ At Least Three Characters](#)

It is hard to find unique names that are less than three
characters—especially on GitHub where your screen name will be used as
the account name there.

## [⏫ Handling Duplicates](#)

Often your name will already be taken. Most will just add a number
after their name until they find one that is unique. If you have
had SkilStak™ register for you then you may have such a name for
GitHub or CodeCombat if your screen name is common. For example,
`mudkip` -> `mudkip1`.
