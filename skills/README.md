# [‚è™ Prep Skills](/README.md)

Prep skills are the things you have to be able to do before you can
hang with those learning to program in Fundamentals. You proceed after 
completed these skills and have them verified by your ***location
manager***, who is like the ‚Äúheadmaster‚Äù in other school systems.

Even though these are called ‚Äúprep‚Äù skills they are extremely valuable
on their own and will serve you well outside of SkilStak‚Ñ¢. This is
because you learn *actual* skills and tools that professionals use,
not some watered-down, made-for-education substitute. Keep this in
mind‚Äîparticularly when something seems difficult. You are learning the
same programming skills many adult professionals still may not have 
learned (and should).

> üí¨ It is more than a little ironic that the most
> sensible way of learning employable skills is still considered rare
> these days. For example, GitHub is still banned in several school
> districts while corporate educational products are forced on students
> that will have no lasting value outside of their school.

**üìñ As you complete the following in your workbook your instructor
will help you check them off.** You should have setup a Gmail before
you arrived at SkilStak‚Ñ¢.  The rest you will accomplish and go over
in class, but you can work on them anytime. They generally should be
done in order.

## [‚è´ Create Google Gmail Account](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/gmail.png)

Having a Google account is an absolute essential today. There's no way
around it. Most web services and games have an option to login with
Google. There is also no email service that beats Gmail in its
ability to filter out spam, manage your inbox, and create multiple
accounts. ***You must have a Google Gmail account to be here,*** not
a Gmail account tied to a Yahoo or Hotmail address, but an *actual*
gmail account. Later, if you really want, you can forward your Gmail
to your other account (but we strongly recommend picking
a Gmail address to use for the rest of your technology life).

### [‚è´ 13 and Up](#table-of-contents)

***If you are under 13 you are not legally allowed to have a Gmail
account.*** Your parents *are* allowed to have an account, however.
Your parents are the ones creating the account and they are the one
using it. This is important to accept and remember. If you are under
13 the Gmail account your parents create is theirs and they are
responsible for how it is used. If you ask really nicely they might
let you use it.

![](/assets/gmail-age.png)

### [‚è´ Your Most Important Password](#table-of-contents)

Gmail is the most important account and password information that you
remember. This is because you can forget the passwords and login
information to everything else and recover it rather simply by
providing your Gmail information that you used to create those
accounts.

When creating an account ***make sure you setup some sort of password
recovery option, preferrably a phone number.***

![](/assets/gmail-recovery.png)

### [‚è´ Multiple Gmail Accounts](#table-of-contents)

One of the main reasons Gmail makes the most sense is its support of
*multiple gmail account names*.

A lot of people don't know that when you create a Gmail account you
are actually creating an infinite number of different email addresses
that you can use for everything and anything, but that all direct
email sent to any of them to the same, single account. For example,
all of the following will go to the same `youraccount@gmail.com`
account:

* `youraccount@gmail.com`
* `your.account@gmail.com`
* `y.o.u.r.a.c.c.o.u.n.t@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+py@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+js@gmail.com`
* `youraccount+whatever@gmail.com`

This is extremely useful when you need more than one account on
another service, like CodeCombat, Twitter, GitHub or whatever else.

## [‚è´ Join the Slack Chat Room](#table-of-contents)

**The chat room is the most important thing for you to remember
from this class.** Everything else depends on it. **You should check
the chat at least once a week** to stay informed about what is going
on. If you forget how to get to it, go to the home page
([skilstak.io](http://skilstak.io)) and find your location. The
chat room is linked from there. If you have questions about anything
else, where something is, how to do it, if we are open, *everything*
is in there. **Each chat room is private for your location and you
can direct message anyone at the location including students and
staff.**

![](/assets/slack.png)

Slack is the leading chat tool used by businesses, schools,
open source development teams, organizations, and about everything
else. It comes with a great mobile app that makes communication in
chat as easy as text messages. This is no *made-for-education* chat
tool, it's a *real* tool used by professionals, which is the main
reason we require learning it. 

### [‚è´ Get an Invite](#table-of-contents)

Because we use a private repo (for obvious reasons) you'll need an
invite from your instructor, teacher assistant, or location manager.
Here's what it looks like in your in box:

![](/assets/slack9.png)

### [‚è´ Accept the Prep Work Repo Invite](#table-of-contents)

Create your own workbook repo by clicking on the pinned invite in your
slack chat room.

## [‚è´ Understand Core Offerings](#table-of-contents)

If we were at Disney Land then *Core Offerings* we be our directional
pillar.  You know those ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù things with a star helping
you see where you fit into it all. So where is your star on our
directional pillar? At the entrance?

![](/assets/core-offerings.png)

Our offerings are divided into four levels or tiers:

1. Preparation
2. Proficiency
3. Project
4. Professional

Each has a general focus and different prices depending on the
location. (While we try to maintain our prices nationally we recognize
there are different costs of living depending on the location.)

### [‚è´ Level 1: Preparation](#table-of-contents)

*[Play][]*, *Prep*, *[Yoga][]*, and *[NewMedia][]* are all at
the *Preparation* level. Stuff here is designed to prepare and 
maintain your programming and other technical skills as you
build them. Before you ask, yes Yoga and YouTube are technical
skills. While *Yoga* and *NewMedia* are listed without connection
to anything they can be taken more than once, but are billed at the
*Preparation* tier. *Prep* and *Play* can also be taken more than once
but *Prep* is generally only needed for one semester (or less).

### [‚è´ Level 2: Proficiency](#table-of-contents)

Proficiency means being able to show that you are able to do
something, that you are competent, that you know the Fundamentals
well. The greater your level of proficiency the closer you get to
mastery. The two *Fundamentals* courses at this level are designed
to help you get proficient in coding, either in *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]* depending on which *[technology path][]* you've chosen.

This level is where things start getting more serious, but fun. Each
90 minute course is divided into three parts:

1. 15 minutes: Homework Review and Help (CodeCombat, etc.)
2. 20 minutes: Instruction from Lesson
3. 40 minutes: Class Work
4. 15 minutes: [Digital Recess][] / [Fundamentals Projects][]

[Fundamentals Projects]: /sections/funproj.md
[Digital Recess]: https://github.com/skilstak/prep/blob/gh-pages/overview/README.md#digital-recess
[technology path]: #-pick-technology-path
[Play]: http://play.skilstak.io

Students are generally expected to work outside of class primarily on
their CodeCombat levels. The first part of class is to help you get
over those parts that you were stuck on over the week. You can also
ask in the chat as well when you get stuck. Sometimes having someone
there just helps the most.

The next part is to present the lesson material for the day. Then,
after questions and answers, you break to work on the lesson for
yourself in your subgroup with your TA.

The last part of class is the same *Digital Recess* as Prep,
but less. You are also encouraged to do one of the [Fundamentals
Projects][] instead.

> Repetition is the mother of learning

Some may achieve proficiency in a month, others a year, others
longer.  There are a lot of things that are involved in how quickly
someone learns something. **The single biggest factor in learning
something is the amount of time practicing the activity.** This
means those who spend time outside of class working on stuff will
advance faster. The smallest factor is aptitude and intelligence.
Remember this. If you find yourself advancing more slowly than
someone else it is very unlikely it is because you are ‚Äúdumber‚Äù
than them. Instead you should look at how much time each day that
you are practicing and see if you can do more. It really is just
as simple as that. If you want to get good, you have to practice.
The sooner you learn that hard lesson the better.

#### Certified Mastery

You don‚Äôt leave the *Proficiency* level until you [certify][]
that you have gained proficiency in either *[Python][]* or
*[Web][]*. Think martial arts v.s. public school. You can‚Äôt
earn a belt just because you changed grades. In fact, the more you
think about it, the more you will realize any organization that is
setup to advance students based on age and grade on a certain time
table is, well, flawed. Everyone is different.

### [‚è´ Level 3: Project](#table-of-contents)

This level is for **exploration and specialization**.  Montessori
has championed the idea that projects foster independence,
accountability, internal drive, and ownership of one‚Äôs own learning.
In that sense we agree a lot with the approach.

We have prepared learning modules (projects) for different *main
focus categories* and are constantly adding more. We also encourage
you to explore things by creating your own learning projects with
the help of your mentor/instructor. Each project will have its own
GitHub Classroom repo to archive and refer back to as well as a
listing in your [SkilStak IDP](http://idp.skilstak.io).

Project level courses can be taken repeatedly. Usually you will see
*Projects* on the weekly schedule when signing up. Sometimes you
will see one of the *main focus categories* instead (*Engineering*,
*Linux*, *Languages*, *Data*, *Apps*, *Game*). Students may register
for more than one time during the week and usually there is one day
during the week with two *Projects* slots back to back creating a
3-hour block for those that want to sign up for both.

#### Main Focus Categories

Currently there are five categories, each with a
[certification](http://certify.skilstak.io) prerequisite. Read more
details about each by following the links:

1. [Python][] -> [Engineering][]
1. [Python][] -> [Linux][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Languages][]
1. [Python][] or [Web][] -> [Data][]
1. [Web][] -> [Apps][]
1. [Web][]  -> [Game][]

[Yoga]: http://yoga.skilstak.io
[NewMedia]: http://newmedia.skilstak.io
[Web]: http://webfun.skilstak.io
[Python]: http://pyfun.skilstak.io
[Engineering]: http://eng.skilstak.io
[Linux]: http://linux.skilstak.io
[Languages]: http://lang.skilstak.io
[Apps]: http://apps.skilstak.io
[Game]: http://game.skilstak.io
[Data]: http://data.skilstak.io
[certify]: http://certify.skilstak.io

Please don't confuse *main focus categories* with a course although
often students with a common focus category will be grouped together
in a *Projects* class for convenience. Sometimes one *Projects*
time will be dedicated to just one category and appear with that
category name on the schedule.

#### Custom Projects

In addition to the *main focus categories* we encouraged students
to come up with their own, (with the help of their mentor/instructor).
For example:

* Other Languages: Go, Node, Java, C/C++, Assembly, Swift, Ruby, Perl
* Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, Certification
* Advanced Engineering with sensors, servos, solder and more
* Building computer clusters with Raspberry Pi
* LPIC Linux Professional Certification
* Retro Gameboy Pi
* Customized drones
* SolidWorks 3D modeling and printing
* 2D and 3D video games in Phaser, Unity and others
* Native Web apps with PhoneGap and React native
* Web APIs: Golang, Node
* Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaSQL
* Frontend frameworks: React, Redux, Angular, Ember
* OAUTH Authentication

One or more semesters of *Projects* courses prepares you well with
stuff to show off in your GitHub repo so the world knows you have
really solidify your mastery of programming and your specialization.
Eventually you might want to pitch one or more of your current or
future projects for the *Professional Incubator Program*.

### [‚è´ Level 4: Professionals](#table-of-contents)

Currently there is only one course at this level: [*Professional Incubator
Program*][Pro]. 

The *Professional* level is for students who have mastered programming
and demonstrated it well during *Projects* classes and now need to
launch into higher education, entrepreneurship, or working for an
organization. In *Projects* you built and explored stuff mostly for
your own learning and curiosity, in *Pro* you work on **stuff that
benefits others**, a client, a community, an organization. You are
contributing, perhaps for free, perhaps not.

<b>You must be invited into *Professional.*</b> To get an invite prepare
a proposal and submit it to your location manager. Your location
manager will review it with staff and decide to accept or not. If not
accepted there is always *Projects*.

The main criteria for giving you an invite will be **how much your
manager personally wants to see your project completed** based on
the needs of your location, your local community, and abroad. Those
projects that provide the most value back to SkilStak and the local
community will almost always get invites provided you have the
fundamental skills to get started on it. Making a game would not
likely get an invite unless the game were educational or included
a tutorial about how to make it.

Projects that have been accepted include creating test prep software
for the public school system, working on open source projects,
creating a programming Summer camp curriculum, performing a security
analysis of an organization, writing a Slackbot to assist students,
and re-imaging laptops with Linux to use with afterschool programs.

It is important to understand that [expectations are different and
higher][expectations] for those at the *Professional* tier, and
that there are fewer spots available.

Pro carries the largest perk privilege of any offering: a free pass to
SkilStak anytime we are open and there is a seat. Not only do you come
on your time slot, but you can attend *any SkilStak course* with
advanced notice at any time for no extra cost. This is because once
approved we want to do everything in our power to help you succeed in
meeting your Pro project goals. This includes use of our lab, 3d
printer, AV equipment, tools, drawing tables, and special high-end
computers that might not be available to you otherwise.

## [‚è´ Pick a Path](#table-of-contents)

Although it might be one of the harder decisions you make, you
really need to pick a primary technology focus, a path early on
since other stuff builds on top of it. You can always change the
path later or do both paths, but for now pick either ***Web*** or
***Python***. 

### [‚è´ Python](#table-of-contents)

The *Python* path leads to [*Engineering*][eng], [*Linux*][linux],
[*Programming Languages*][lang], and [*Data Science*][data] focus
categories in the [*Project*][project] courses to follow.

![](/assets/python.png)

[eng]: http://eng.skilstak.io
[linux]: http://linux.skilstak.io
[lang]: http://lang.skilstak.io
[data]: http://data.skilstak.io
[project]: http://project.skilstak.io

Choose *Python* if you love the hacker-feel of nothing but a powerful
command-line running raw code. While Python is still used extensively
for graphic applications and even to serve web sites its primary
use today is for server administration, automation, engineering,
number crunching, and data science. Python is also embedded in lots
of other applications like Photoshop, Blender and others.

The *Python* path takes less time because it is only one language,
not three.

### [‚è´ Web](#table-of-contents)

The *Web* path leads to [*Game*][game], [*Apps*][apps], [*Programming
Languages*][lang], and [*Database*][data] focus categories in the
[*Project*][project] courses.

[game]: http://game.skilstak.io
[apps]: http://apps.skilstak.io

![](/assets/web.png)

Choose *Web* if you really enjoy anything graphic, or with moving
graphic parts. Web technology is mostly about front end
presentation, interfaces, and graphic interactivity.

*Web* technology is exploding as more moves the web browser.
Everything from simple web pages and games to complex applications
are being created using web technology today. Web technology can be
found on more devices than any other technology in history.
Web technology is actually three technologies used together:

* Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* JavaScript (JavaScript)

So, yeah, learning web technology takes longer but has a real wide
variety of uses. 

JavaScript is used in [Unity](http://unity3d.com) for 3D game and
simulation development.  Web technology can be used to make full
desktop applications like [Slack](http://slack.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io) with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io). And, of

## [‚è´ Create CodeCombat.com Account(s)](#table-of-contents)

Welcome to CodeCombat, the most fun we have found to learn
programming online. Let's create an account, or two.

![codecombat](/assets/desert.png)

> üí¨ We are shocked that
> CodeCombat has actually been banned in some public schools because,
> and I quote, ‚ÄúIt is a game.‚Äù These same schools promote code.org,
> (which is not real programming), and codeacademy, (which is full of
> job-stopping bugs and incorrect syntax, which have been reported
> and remain after seven years). Here are some more reasons we
> *love* CodeCombat and think it is really the best online learning
> resource for programming available to students ages eight and up.
> 
> **Open Source:** The source of [CodeCombat is completely open
> and available][open] for anyone to use or modify as they wish. This
> is a major reason we use CodeCombat. Everything we do is completely
> available for free and we feel strongly in supporting those that
> feel the same way whether it be CodeCombat, [FreeCodeCamp][], or
> [MIT][].
>
> **Responsive Team of Developers:** The team behind CodeCombat is
> amazing and available pretty much constantly via their [public
> developer chat channels][chat]. If you think you have found a bug
> jump into the chat room and let them know.  They'll appreciate it.
> In fact, the developers and architects are often available for a
> phone conversation to discuss ways to make CoCo even better. This
> is unfortunately a rare thing when it comes to a lot of educational
> offerings out there.

### [‚è´ Create Two Accounts](#table-of-contents)

When you [picked your primary technology path](#-pick-a-path), you also
picked the main language you will learn in CodeCombat, Python or
JavaScript (Web). You should go ahead and create accounts for both
languages right just both are there when you want them. If you are
dedicated you can actually do them both. 

Avoid the temptation to create a Google+ account because that requires
you to be logged into Google from that browser, which prevents you
from easily switching between the different languages.

![](/assets/coco6.png)

### [‚è´ Repeat](#table-of-contents)

Now that you have completed the steps to signup for one account,
say `+py`, do them again for an account for the other language, say
`+js`. One will be your primary account, but having them both let's
you work on both if you have extra time or want to work on more at
home.

## [‚è´ Remember Passwords!](#table-of-contents)

Remembering passwords is a part of modern life‚Äîeven if you
never become a programmer. Developing your own system for remembering
them reliably is an essential requirement. Forgetting a password
can cost you and the class 10 minutes or more as we attempt to
restore it and contact your parents to do it.  **Even worse, a
forgotten GitHub password can lock out an entire class.**

If you regularly forget your password in Fundamentals you really
need to return to Prep until have managed to work out a way not to
forget.

### [‚è´ Strategies](#table-of-contents)

Beyond memorizing passwords or even having them all be the same, which
rarely works for a long time, consider creating a notebook or piece of
paper that you bring with you to class, or take a picture of it with
your phone. Don't forget a backup.

### [‚è´ Google Password Recovery](#table-of-contents)

**The most important password of all is your Google/Gmail password.**
All other passwords can be recovered by opening  up your email and
resetting from the email sent to you. But if you can't open your Gmail
you are really stuck.

Therefore, when you create a Gmail make sure to fill in the phone
number and alternative email parts so that there is always a backup
in you forget even your Gmail. Make sure you keep this information
current, say, for example, when you or your parents get a new phone.
Make sure the latest is in there.

## [‚è´ Know Your Web Sites](#table-of-contents)

When all else fails and you do not know where to find everything go to
[skilstak.io](http://skilstak.io) and look for your location. It
should never be that hard. From there you can find your chat room for
asking questions and the shortcuts to all the course materials.
Knowing the other web sites we talk about is important as well.

### [‚è´ Main](#table-of-contents)

The main web site is [`skilstak.io`](http://skilstak.io). Going to
[`skilstak.com`](http://skilstak.com) will also work by being
redirected.

### [‚è´ Location](#table-of-contents)

Each location has a unique name that when added to the front of the
`skilstak.io`, (called a sub domain), will get you to your location‚Äôs
web site. Each location web site is run by the location manager of
that site and may be different depending on the location.

### [‚è´ Shortcuts](#table-of-contents)

There are a bunch of shortcuts that will auto-complete in your
browser easily once you have visited them. To see them all click
on the anchor icon from `skilstak.io` or just go to
[`shortcuts.skilstak.io`](http://shortcuts.skilstak.io). Each course and project focus category has it‚Äôs own shortcut.

### [‚è´ Personal](#table-of-contents)

After *Prep* you should have a personal web site started. This is
yours to work on however you wish. It will be a `github.io` domain
unless you have setup a custom domain. Make a note of it in your
work repo.

## [‚è´ Agree to Policies](#table-of-contents)

Blah, blah. Yeah, I know. Policies are lame. But it is kinda important
that you‚Äîand more importantly‚Äîyour parents understand them. 

### [‚è´ Payment](#table-of-contents)

All payment is due in advance by the posted deadline, no exceptions.
All payments are through PayPal. Deadlines are listed on your
location's web site and calendar. *Senior Students* can earn
up to full tuition in rebates working on staff as teacher assistants
and such if they qualify and are selected.

### [‚è´ Strikes](#table-of-contents)

Students automatically agree to the [student pledge](#-student-pledge)
when they register. Violations of the pledge, as judged by the
instructor and/or the location manager, will be counted as strikes.
Three strikes and students are immediately removed from SkilStak
with no refund.  A strike can be cleared after one year without any
additional strikes.

Strikes for the school are more severe and are different than
[strikes for Pro](http://github.com/skilstak/pro).

### [‚è´ No Refunds](#table-of-contents)

No refunds will be given. Decisions about whether to have a given
course are based on registration numbers not changing. **When in
doubt apply for less or don't apply at all.** Our students deserve
to have other students as committed as them who will seek opportunities
to work on stuff even outside of class and who would rarely miss a
week and, even then, only for extreme exceptions.

In exceptional cases‚Äîwith written approval from the location
manager‚Äîtuition paid that would otherwise be lost can be used **up
to a year** from that date for other programs for which the student
may still be eligible or given to another family member or student
currently still enrolled in the school or to a new applicant.

### [‚è´ Referral Bonus](#table-of-contents)

If a new student gives the email address or exact name of a current
student or parent who has referred them ***before*** the new person
pays for their registration the person named will receive 5% off
their next semester enrollment. The new person does not receive any
discount.

### [‚è´ First Paid, First Registered](#table-of-contents)

All courses require full payment to reserve a place in that course.
Courses do and will fill far before the registration/payment deadline.
Watch the calendar to keep track of how courses are filling.

### [‚è´ Changing Classes](#table-of-contents)

Students can always switch class times if there is room. This allows
students to find a class with the group and feel that works best for
them.

### [‚è´ Four Students Minimum Required to Hold Course](#table-of-contents)

Courses with less than four enrolled at the beginning of the
semester will be canceled and the money returned if another suitable
class is not available. This is the only case where refunds are
offered.

### [‚è´ Learning to Code Demands Regular Attendance](#table-of-contents)

We didn't make this rule, the coding gods did. Learning computer
programming requires regular, consistent contact with it. Moreover
the pace of instruction at our nano-school requires high-level of
commitment from every student. We demand it from our students and
they each demand it from each other. Unlike other schools, missing
even one class is very disruptive for everyone if it is not properly
made up.

### [‚è´ Makeups](#table-of-contents)

We understand students will have to miss occasionally for sickness,
weather, or other conflicts. We offer up to, (but not more than),
two makeups up to two weeks from the time of the first missed class.
In other words, **all makeup opportunities expire two weeks from
the date of the missed class**. Students can either attend the same
course at a different time in addition to their regular course or
can arrange to make up material during the time of a different
course.

**All makeups require 48 hour advanced notice by email to [your
location's email
address](communications.md#enrollment-and-makeups-use-email) to
attend** in order to arrange for the proper number of teacher
assistants and such. **Makeups are never as good as classes because
multiple courses are represented in the lab.** When in doubt call
or ask first.

### [‚è´ Loss of Eligibility](#table-of-contents)

As unpleasant as it is to discuss it is important students and
parents understand that **we reserve the right to deny any
application or withdraw enrollment eligibility from any student for
any reason at any time with no refund**. This is very rare and every
effort is made to ensure such students are not accepted into the
school in the first place.

Students who become abusive, physical, harassing, disrespectful,
or distract others from learning in any way, who regularly lose
focus, who fail to complete projects, or who require more than one
assistant per three students to meet their attention needs will not
be eligible for continued enrollment. In severe cases parents will
be called to immediately remove the former student from the school.

We have the somewhat unique privilege to ensure only those
that are willing to learn and help are in the school. For the good
of those students contributing and learning we will not hesitate
to take immediate action when needed to maintain the best possible
learning environment.

### [‚è´ Parent Visits](#table-of-contents)

We welcome and encourage visits from parents to monitor any class
in which their student is enrolled. However, due the size or our
classrooms, and in order to not overbook too many monitoring parents
at a time, we require at least one week (7-days) advanced notice by
email.

### [‚è´ Understand Communications](#table-of-contents)

Parents and student are responsible to ensure they understand
and use the [communications methods described
separately](communications.md).

### [‚è´ Staff Rebates](#table-of-contents)

**SkilStak‚Ñ¢ works because of its students, literally.** Exceptional
students fulfill the needs of other students as the serve as
teacher assistants, student instructors, system administrators, and
developers.

Students can earn up to the cost of their entire tuition in rebates
for working on SkilStak‚Ñ¢ staff. However, since most students are under
the age they cannot legally be paid as contractors or employees.
Therefore, the maximum any student can work for SkilStak‚Ñ¢ and be paid
is the cost of their tuition. Students can enroll for more offerings
if they wish to work more.

### [‚è´ PayPal](#table-of-contents)

**All transactions are through PayPal‚Ñ¢**, payment, rebates, everything.
Legally a student must be over 18 to use a PayPal account individually
without being tied to a parent. When staff rebates and/or payments
are made the student and parent provide the email to receive the
funds via PayPal. SkilStak‚Ñ¢ is not responsible for anything beyond
that transfer of funds including security breaches of the student
or parent‚Äôs account or lost or forgotten passwords.

As with any financial transactions **the security of the student
or parent‚Äôs PayPal account is the responsibility of the student or
parent not SkilStak‚Ñ¢**. Care should be taken to security that account
including two-factor authentication, strong passwords, and frequent
account reviews. SkilStak‚Ñ¢ is not responsible for any loss of funds
for any reason for any staff member account once the receipt of the
money has been acknowledged.

## [‚è´ Understand Communications](#table-of-contents)

Learning how to communicate while you are here is very important
to avoid misunderstanding, so let's go over the methods of communication
we use.

### [‚è´ Learn to Communicate for Yourself](#table-of-contents)

As soon as possible we want you to learn to communicate for yourself.
Without communication skills none of the other programming and tech
skills matter, unfortunately. Everyone communicates differently but
this is *your* responsibility (not your parents'). At first your
parents can communicate for you, but eventually you are *required*
to communicate for yourself at SkilStak. Students in *Pro* simply
have to. This is much like having a job, even if you worked at a
local store you could not have your parents call or send email
telling your boss you were sick or otherwise could not come in to
work. We expect the same of our *Pros*. Best to get into the habit
as early as possible.

### [‚è´ Urgent, Immediate: Use the Phone of Text](#table-of-contents)

Your location has a phone number that will always allow you or your
parents to immediately and directly communicate with the that
location's manager, who lives on or around that location. Use this
method for emergencies, notifications of being late, etc. We will
do our best to answer every text of phone message immediately. Take a
moment to write down your locations phone number if you don't already
have it:

### [‚è´ Announcements and Info: Use Site and Slack #news](#table-of-contents)

If you want to see if we are open over a particular holiday you might
just check your locations web site. Look for the yearly calendar.

### [‚è´ Help and Ideas: Slack](#table-of-contents)

If you have a question about a level in CodeCombat or any course
material Slack is the place to be. Dozens of other students are there
to help you as well as staff. You should get into the habit of
checking the Slack room at least once a week:

This is also where students collaborate with each other
and instructors to get extra projects done.

The #news channel will only be for news. #random is for #random fun
within reason. #parents is specifically for parent to find carpools
etc.

Our Slack room for every location is invite-only so you will have to
have your instructor, assistant, or location manager send you an
invite.

### [‚è´ Enrollment and Makeups: Use Email](#table-of-contents)

Email will always be the primary method of registration for any
SkilStak location and is processed by the location manager combined
with PayPal invoicing. You, as a student, might not care about that,
but your parents will. Having an email history has proven the most
personable and least error prone approach.

### [‚è´ Consultation: Email and Drop In](#table-of-contents)

Sometimes speaking in person is the right thing to do. When that is
the case please send an email setting up a time and the location
manager will be happy to meet with you as soon as can be scheduled.
Usually this will not be during the break between classes due to the
amount of activity requiring the manager's attention during that time.

### [‚è´ General News and Information](#table-of-contents)

You will get a newsletter through the mailing list
once a month containing general news and information about changes
to schedules, course, and policies; special offers and events; and
upcoming important dates. You can respond to these emails as well
if you have questions.

## [‚è´ Sign Student Pledge](#table-of-contents)

![dude-be-nice](/assets/dude-be-nice.png)

Yeah, that, be nice. That's it. That's the pledge, (which we [borrowed
a bit](https://www.dudebenice.com/)). But case you were wondering
all of the following fall in the "be nice" category:

* Do help people out if they ask are stuck on something

* Do be on time, it sucks for everyone when you are late, really

* Do leave on time, it sucks for everyone when you don't, really

* Do be authentic, no need to lie

* Be respectful

* Take responsibility for your own actions and learning and
  attendance, your mom and dad aren't here. Speak for yourself. Send
  your own email questions. Learn to be independent. It's the nice
  thing to do.

And here are some things that can get you a strike:

* Touching someone else's computer, ever, even if you think it will
  be funny

* Changing anything on a computer except the background (passwords,
  users, etc.)

* Accessing or attempting to access any information from any other
  student or staff member without their consent including code, art,
  passwords, or other personal information. Violating this will not
  only get you a strike, but risk of prosecution by local authorities.

* Touching other people in class, ever, even if you think it will
  be funny

* Bullying, don't even joke around about bullying, even if you
  think it will be funny

* Disrespect others, even subtly including your friends,
  parents, other students, and your instructor

* Criticizing and putting down others. When someone asks for your
  opinion be nice and be honest

* Using hate speech, symbols, or inappropriate language, jokes, or
  references. Keep everything rated G

* Willful destruction of property or leaving trash around. This
  includes gum under the chairs and tables

* Thinking somehow you are an exception

There's a lot more that falls under "be nice" see if you can think of
others.

And girls? "Dude" is a non-gender-specific term, so yeah, you are
included. 

### [‚è´ Sign](#table-of-contents)

Sign this pledge by creating an issue in your workbook titled
*Student Pledge* with ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù as a comment. Your location manager
will acknowledge and close it during your IDP discussion.

## [‚è´ Attain 24 Words Per Minute Typing](#table-of-contents)

**Typing is the most important skill of a programmer.** (The next
most important is reading.) Unless you have a physical disability
you must type at least 24 words per minute before moving to
*Fundamentals*. There are many places online to practice, which you
can Google, but the test must be on
[typingtest.com](http://typingtest.com). Record your score in your
workbook including improvements as you make them, (which can actually
be tracked through GitHub).

### [‚è´ Do I have to do home-row typing?](#table-of-contents)

You really should. While I have know typists to get into the 60 wpm
range with just hunting and pecking, those who type in the 90 and
even 100 wpm range always use home row (and, incidentally, have
learned to use `ctrl-[` instead of `ESC` key). Take the time now to
learn it the right way. There is no rush. Invest in yourself and be
patient.

## [‚è´ Toggle Applications with One Hand](#table-of-contents)

> üí¨ It might seem like a small thing, but this one skill can save you
> more than an hour a day during development. It also saves your right
> wrist from the risk of developing carpel tunnel syndrome because you
> are not moving constantly to the mouse during a coding session

To switch between running applications on *any* modern desktop or
laptop computer press *Command* (‚åò) and *Tab*, or ‚åò-TAB. Look for
the equivalent key on a Linux or Windows machine, usually *Alt*. This
key can be changed in the System Settings if it is in an inconvenient
place.

![](/assets/cmd-tab.gif)

When done properly your left hand makes a capital L as you hold down
*Command* and tap *Tab*. When you hold *Command* down you not only
toggle between the last application but can choose from any of the
currently running applications. 

> üí¨ This is particularly useful when developing on a laptop and you
> need all of the screen for both programming and viewing your web
> site or documentation on a web site. This way you can quickly switch
> between the web browser and even a full-screen terminal.

## [‚è´ Close a Window](#table-of-contents)

Often you just want to quickly close a window without having to use
the mouse. *Command-w* (‚åò-w) does this most efficiently. Linux has an
equivalent. 

> üí¨ The Windows equivalent is *Alt* + *F4*, which is completely
> ridiculous and unusable.

## [‚è´ Close an Application](#table-of-contents)

To close an entire application use *Command-q* (‚åò-q). This is yet
another opportunity to save a wrist-straining trip to the mouse.

> üí¨ If you are young you may not see the initial value of doing as
> much from the keyboard as possible but the savings in time and
> health are tremendous over many years. Sometimes it is the small
> things that add up that make great differences.

## [‚è´ Take Some Screenshots](#table-of-contents)

Screenshots are fundamental to communicating these days‚Äîespecially
when designing a new app or program or writing up documentation.
The best explanation of screen shots is at
[take-a-screenshot.org](http://www.take-a-screenshot.org).

### [‚è´ Mac](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/screenshot-mac.png)

On Mac you can also use the [Skitch App](https://evernote.com/skitch/)
to add arrows and annotations to your screenshots.

### [‚è´ Linux](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/screenshot-linux.png)

### [‚è´ Windows](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/screenshot-win.png)

### [‚è´ Animated GIFs](#table-of-contents)

On Mac you can use the [GIPHY Capture
App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/giphy-capture.-the-gif-maker/id668208984?mt=12).

## [‚è´ Complete the Markdown Tutorial](#table-of-contents)

All your workbook work and most of your code documentation will be
written in Markdown, a very basic language for adding things to text.
Complete the [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com) online.

Markdown is an important language that almost does not seem like
a language. It is designed to look just like what you would type in
text if you wanted to emphasize something or create a link to another
web page. **All of this [SkilStak‚Ñ¢ GitHub Textbook][t] is written in
Markdown.** You may not know it yet, but many sites allow Markdown to
be used wherever text is allowed.

## [‚è´ Edit a File with GitHub](#table-of-contents)

Editing files on GitHub is relatively easy. Here's how.

## [‚è´ Create First GitHub Issue](#table-of-contents)

Issues (also sometimes called ‚Äútickets‚Äù) are how you keep track of
work and information related to your GitHub project repo. We use these
a lot to communicate about work in the course. It is a good habit to
get into because that is the same most open source and other GitHub
projects work.

## [‚è´ Create Custom Issue Labels](#table-of-contents)

Sometimes the labels on an issue don‚Äôt really fit. For example, we
will use issues to track reviews, acknowledgments, and adding
todos.

## [‚è´ Create Your First Web Site](#table-of-contents)

You should have already created the GitHub repo for your web site
when you created your GitHub account. If not, go back and do that.

### [‚è´ Update Your `index.html` File](#table-of-contents)

The one we made when we created our GitHub account just had plain old
text in it. We are going to get a little fancy here, but nothing too
crazy.

## [‚è´ Dragging a File Into a GitHub Repo](#table-of-contents)

To load a file (image, pdf, etc.) into a GitHub repo, just drag it
in and commit it.

![](/assets/github-dnd2.gif)

### [‚è´ File Name Caution](#table-of-contents)

Often spaces in file names can cause complications. It is generally
a good idea to remove them or replace them with hyphen `-` or
underscore `_`. These days hyphen is more popular‚Äîespecially for web
content.

## [‚è´ Learn to Learn, Just in Time](#table-of-contents)

Anyone who has spent any amount of time in IT knows the most important
skill to learn is how to learn, often just in time to make the
deadline. When combined with a solid foundation in logical thinking
and creative problem solving just-in-time learning allows those in
IT to quickly digest any relevant technology, understand it, and
apply it productively. 

![dreams](/assets/dreams.jpg)

> Just do it. Don't let your dreams be dreams. Learn to learn.  

How do you identify people who have not learned this important
skill?  By the number of times they ask stupid questions they could
have researched themselves in seconds. You know the type. The ones
to lazy to *read the freaking manual* themselves and have no problem
wasting your time to fix their problems. ["Here let me Google that
for you,"](http://lmgtfy.com) is the usual response to this unfortunate
type of individual.  Don't be one of these.  Don't hate 'em, just
don't be one.

## [‚è´ What is Coding?](#table-of-contents)

[![](/assets/coding.png)][code]

Coding, programming, computer science, what do all these terms
means?

Coding is what happens when you write code. What's code?  Well,
this [Bloomberg article *What is Code?*][code] answers that best,
but the short answer is the stuff you type to make stuff happen on
the computer in a way that can be repeated.

[code]: http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/

### [‚è´ Coding or Programming?](#table-of-contents)

To be purely pedantic, *coding* is **not** *programming*, but
*programming* ***is*** *coding*. HTML, for example, is Hyper-Text
**Markup** Language. It‚Äôs code, but its not programming. It‚Äôs like
a PDF document, it‚Äôs code to show how something should appear, but
their isn‚Äôt really logic.  *JavaScript*, on the other hand, *is*
programming.  When in doubt, if it doesn‚Äôt have an `if` statement it‚Äôs
probably not programming. We prefer the term coding because a lot
of coding is creating the framework and content for how stuff should
appear‚Äîespecially web development.

### [‚è´ Programming is Not Computer Science](#table-of-contents)

These terms get mixed up all the time. Most recently I heard about
a high school club changing its name from the ‚ÄúCoding Club‚Äù to
‚ÄúComputer Science Club.‚Äù I am pretty sure they did not understand
the difference in terminology.

*Computer Science* is a term you will likely see in a University
course catalog. It is the study of what computers *can* do. Programming
is the study of *how* to make them do those things. Theoretically you
could get a PhD in computer science and never learn to program. And
there are thousands of amazingly good programmers who don‚Äôt know‚Äîand
do not need to know‚Äîa thing about computer science.

[![](/assets/makinde.png)](https://youtu.be/nKIu9yen5nc?t=1m30s)

As Makinde says,

> ‚ÄúA lot of the coding that people actually do is actually fairly
> simple. It‚Äôs more about the process of breaking down problems than
> coming up with complicated algorithms as people traditionally think
> about it.‚Äù

So yeah, maybe you do need to be a genius to be a really good computer
scientist, just like you would need to be to be a great physicist, but
programming does *not* require you do be a genius at all.

## [‚è´ Organic Learning](#table-of-contents)

Mother nature has a phenomenally awesome [pedagogy][]. As harsh as
natural selection seems to us it is well-tested and effective. 

![organic](/assets/organic.png)
When something doesn‚Äôt work it ends leaving the best to continue.
Consider the wildly complex solutions to problems that nature has
solved in an observable way. Trial and error, that is how nature
arrives at its best and that is how SkilStak and our students arrive
at their best. ‚ÄúPractice, practice, practice and all is coming.‚Äù
This method involves a lot of repetition, experimentation, failure,
and adaptation.  It also means none of us are ever finished improving
and changing.  We own it. We'll forget a lot along the way and there
is always more to learn, always a better way to be discovered. There
is no ‚ÄúI'm finished‚Äù, only ‚ÄúI‚Äôm finished for today‚Äù.

### [‚è´ Learning is Messy](#table-of-contents)

Learning this way is messy. We start out in Prep with some organized
approaches to get started, but the deeper learning comes as you let go
of organized assignments and even projects and begin experimenting.
Don't worry about it being clean and tidy at first. Just start coding,
start building something, and you can begin to shape your construction
as you go. This creative process is essential and the secret to not
only great ideas, but great art.

![messy](/assets/messy.png)

Later after your creation has taken form and you are sure you want to
continue down that path, you can fine tune it, refactor it, and make
is pretty.

## [‚è´ Choosing a Computer](#table-of-contents)

![mini](/assets/apple-mini.jpg)
![macbook](/assets/macbookpro.jpeg)
![cana](/assets/canakit.jpg)
![ubuntu](/assets/ubuntu.png)

This first thing we need to say is you do not have to purchase a new
computer to be a student at SkilStak. You can likely use whatever
computer you already have at home. 

But when holidays and birthdays come up this question gets asked a lot.
Our answer is short, opinionated, and unapologetic:

1. Buy a Mac laptop (Macbook Air or higher if you can) ~ $1800
2. Buy a Mac (Mini, iMac or Pro) ~ $500 ‚Äî $3000
3. Buy a cheap PC and install [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) ~ $300
4. Buy a Raspberry Pi ([Canakit][]) ~ $80 - $100
5. Install an Ubuntu virtual machine (on a PC) ~ free if you have

[Canakit]: https://amzn.com/B01C6Q2GSY

Options #1 and #2 will put you in sync with SkilStak and professional
tools and workflows immediately. Their experience at home will be
identical to that at SkilStak and later at work and in computer
science programs.

Option #3 is also used at SkilStak and in computer science programs
but is not commonly available to the average consumer and requires
the step of installing Ubuntu Linux Operating System, which is the
most widely supported Linux OS. This option is cheaper than buying
a Mac but requires more setup time.

Option #4 is the same as #3 but cheaper and with no installation to
do. Just trade in your micro SD card for one of ours preloaded with
our custom SkilStak Ubuntu Linux image already on it. You will still
need to find a screen to connect it to (any TV will do) and a keyboard
and a mouse that suits you. This option is also preferred if you plan
on pursuing [*Engineering*](http://eng.skilstak.io) projects.

Option #5 allows you to create a virtual machine that runs as an
application inside of your Windows or Mac OS. You start it up just
like any other application but the application is itself another
machine, another operating system. Doing this is extremely complicated
for the average person to do. Keep in mind that using a virtual
machine takes up more RAM and CPU than a normal application.

### [‚è´ Developers Overwhelmingly Prefer Mac and Linux](#table-of-contents)

Facts:

* Most of the web runs on Linux machines.
* Most of the web is developed on Macs.

SkilStak is focused on helping others learn backend and frontend
engineering. Both of these industry domains are dominated by Mac and
Linux. 

UNIX machines where invented for colleges such as MIT and others
where thousands of users simultaneously worked, emailed and
communicated with IRC chat. In fact, the world wide web was invented
on a UNIX system as was email, FTP and every other major component of
the Internet. Windows was barely functioning as a desktop operating
system at that time.

Linux was designed to model the user experience of UNIX but be
completely free and open source. GNU/Linux is the original and
current accurate name because it combines GNU, which is an open
source port of all the common UNIX commands, and Linux, the kernel
developed by Linux Torvalds. It is not an exaggeration to say the
Internet was invented on UNIX and now runs mostly on Linux.

Once upon a time Mac computers were only preferred by creatives who
needed a highly visual environment. The term Windows was a rip off of
what Apple had produced. 

Something very significant happened when Steve Jobs returned from
NeXT to Apple. He changed the entire underlying operating system.
Under the hood Mac Darwin is now mostly based on the FreeBSD UNIX
operating system Jobs brought over from NeXT when he came back.
This is not Linux but feels very much like it, which is why command
line developers and good system administrators prefer it. **Jobs had the
foresight to see UNIX/LINUX would become the predominant choice of
developers because of the extremely powerful command line.**

Even if you want or need Windows for software and games you can still
get a Mac and Bootcamp it into Windows. The same is *not* true for
a Windows machine.

### [‚è´ So what do you have against Microsoft?](#table-of-contents)

Microsoft dominates 3D at the moment but is a far inferior server
operating system down to the very core mostly because it was not
designed from the very beginning to be a multiuser system. Everything
to allow that has been hacked onto it over the years. In order to
administer a MS server you have to use some sort of graphic terminal
connection. You simply cannot connect directly to a command line
shell. It is absolutely astounding so many enterprise decision makers
have allowed that many MS servers into their architecture.

Today, Microsoft is changing rapidly to comply with the standards
allowing Linux on their Azure cloud and shoe-horning Bash command
line into Windows 10 (for developers only). These are things Mac
and Linux have had for more than 16 years. Yet you still cannot log in
to a Windows machine command line remotely over ssh. There are
products that attempt to allow this, but fundamentally it is not
included.

If you are a gamer or creating anything in 3D you want Windows. A
lot of developers secretly want a killer gaming system and find a
way to justify getting a Windows machine because of it. If that is
you, just own it. [Here is more of the unapologetic truth about why
we find Microsoft a poor
choice.](https://github.com/skilstak/faq/blob/gh-pages/microsoft.md) Be
warned. It might offend you. Why is all this MS bashing in a Prep
course? Because we want you to understand immediately how we feel
so that if you disagree you can decide now to find an alternative
that teaches Microsoft. We never will.

## [‚è´ Login with Mac Terminal](#table-of-contents)

Macs come with a powerful Bash command line. It is one reason Macs
have become a main tool of developers. Here is how to pull a terminal
in the fastest way possible using Spotlight, which is like Google for
your Mac to find stuff. Get used to using it. It is much faster than
navigating through folders in the file system.

### [‚è´ `‚åò + Space` for Spotlight](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/login-mac1.gif)

### [‚è´ Secure Shell Login to `skilstak.sh`](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/login-mac.gif)

### [‚è´ `‚åò + +/-` to Increase/Decrease Font Size](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/terminal-font-size.gif)

### [‚è´ `‚åò + crtl + f` to Full Screen](#table-of-contents)

![](/assets/terminal-full-screen.gif)

## [‚è´ Login with CodeAnywhere.com](#table-of-contents)

CodeAnywhere connects you to anything from anywhere, including from
places that might have blocked SSH connections directly, (which
makes no sense at all). However, it does take some help navigating
your first time. Here is how to setup a connection to `skilstak.sh`
that it will remember.

Before you get started make sure you are using [Chrome
Incognito](#-chrome-incognito) so you don‚Äôt accidentally login as
the person before you or so that no one *after* you logs in as you.

### [‚è´ Creating an Account: GitHub or Google?](#table-of-contents)

You can create an account with either GitHub or Google. It makes
better sense to use GitHub, however, because some of the services
allow you to connect to GitHub repos. Either one will work for logging
in to `skilstak.sh`.

![](/assets/codeanywhere1.gif)

### [‚è´ SFTP-SSH Connection Setup](#table-of-contents)

Click on the `SFTP-SSH` on the left side, then fill out your
information. Remember `you` is not *you*. Ask your instructor for your
user name if you don‚Äôt already know it.

![](/assets/codeanywhere2.gif)

### [‚è´ Only for Education](#table-of-contents)

It is worth mentioning that everything you type when using
CodeAnywhere travels through servers owned by CodeAnywhere. Even if
that does not concern you, it definitely would concern an employer. In
other words, you probably should not use CodeAnywhere for anything but
education.

### [‚è´ Slower](#table-of-contents)

This method sends everything you type indirectly through CodeAnywhere
making it slower and seem a bit laggy at times. For a faster
connection use [Terminal](terminal.md) or install the [Chrome SSH
Extension](chrome-ssh.md) but keep in mind both of these make a direct
connection, which might be blocked depending on where you are
connecting from.

### [‚è´ No Solarized](#table-of-contents)

Yeah, this is a real bummer we haven‚Äôt been able to solarize the
terminal in CodeAnywhere.

![](/assets/codeanywhere3.gif)

### [‚è´ Alternative Editor](#table-of-contents)

As much as we love VIM, sometimes you might want to use the Atom-like
editor from CodeAnywhere, if even just to have a color scheme better
than VIM without solarized.

![](/assets/codeanywhere4.gif)

## [‚è´ Bash Command Line Essentials](#table-of-contents)

`bash` is the most powerful, prominent command line in history.
Every Mac and Linux machine comes with it and [Windows *finally*
added it](https://github.com/skilstak/faq/blob/gh-pages/microsoft.md)
to their developer version. This is the reason we have a `skilstak.sh`
is to ensure everyone learns the power of the command line as
professional do. At this point you should already known how to connect
with the [Terminal](terminal.md) or [CodeAnywhere](codeanywhere.md).

### [‚è´ Login](#table-of-contents)

After you login you will see the *message of the day*, which includes
a reminder that you can type `h` to get the help from anywhere.

![](/assets/motd-h.png)

### [‚è´ Help](#table-of-contents)

Nope, it is not `help`, (which is used for something else by the
system), it‚Äôs `h`.

![](/assets/h.png)

By the way, this is a little thing we added that is not normally there
for SkilStak‚Ñ¢ students.

### [‚è´ List Files and Directories](#table-of-contents)

You probably know what a file is. A ***directory*** is another name
for a folder and usually has a folder icon, but no icons on the
command line. Here‚Äôs how to list stuff. Notice that the files are
different colors. We will get to that in a minute.

![](/assets/ls.gif)

### [‚è´ Long Listing](#table-of-contents)

If you add a `-l`, so `ls -l` (there‚Äôs a space there) it will show you
the same thing, but in a longer listing. From this long listing you
can see that the information about each thing is different. Again,
we‚Äôll get into that more later. For now just know what one of the
files is a program that can be run and the other a plain text file.

![](/assets/ls-l.gif)

### [‚è´ Long Listing of a Single File](#table-of-contents)

You can isolate the `ls` command to just show one or more things. This
time we just want to look at the `hello` program.

![](/assets/ls-l-hello.gif)

### [‚è´ Long Listing of Everything](#table-of-contents)

Unix and Linux have a nice way of hiding stuff. This makes it less
cluttered. Sometimes, however, you want to look at it all. That‚Äôs what
the `-a` is for, so `ls -la`.

![](/assets/ls-la.gif)

### [‚è´ Clearing the Screen](#table-of-contents)

At this point you screen is probably getting pretty cluttered up. The
`clear` command does just that so you can start fresh. Don‚Äôt worry,
everything is still there.

![](/assets/clear.gif)

### [‚è´ You are Here](#table-of-contents)

The `pwd` command is for when you are wondering where you are. It
stands for ‚Äúprint working directory‚Äù but just know that it shows you
the ***full path*** to where you are in the file system.

![](/assets/pwd.gif)

### [‚è´ Make a Directory](#table-of-contents)

Let‚Äôs make a directory to put our stuff in. In fact, let‚Äôs make the
special `repos` directory that we all use at SkilStak‚Ñ¢ to store our
GitHub repos.

![](/assets/mkdir-cd-repos.gif)

Notice as soon as we make it we change directories into it. The
command is `cd repos` to do that.

### [‚è´ Change Up One Directory](#table-of-contents)

To change to the directory one level above where we are, sometimes
called the *parent directory* use the special `..` directory:

![](/assets/cd-dotdot.gif)

### [‚è´ Change to the Home Directory](#table-of-contents)

If you use `cd` without anything else it assumes you want to go back
to start, to your home directory.

![](/assets/cd.gif)

### [‚è´ Using Tab Completion](#table-of-contents)

If you have played Minecraft at all they you have been well trained in
tab completion. It is when you type tab to get the computer to help
you out by guessing what the next thing to type is. In this example we
use it to type out the only directory names that are there. The screen
will blink when there are no more options when you keep hitting tab.
If there is more than one option pushing tab a second time lists out
all the possibilities that you can then use to continue typing the one
you want.

![](/assets/tab-completion.gif)

Understanding tab completion is the difference between a good command
line magician and a freaking 25th level wizard. Get used to using it.

### [‚è´ Change to User‚Äôs Home Directory](#table-of-contents)

If you have permission and want to use a shortcut to go to another
user‚Äôs home directory put the user name after the tilde with no space.

![](/assets/cd-tilde.gif)

Notice we have set it up so you can‚Äôt peek at your neighbors by
default.

### [‚è´ Creating, Setting Permissions, and Editing a Script](#table-of-contents)

There is a lot in this step but we put it all together because you are
going to be doing it a lot. 

First we create the file with the `touch hello` command, which just
makes an empty file if the file doesn‚Äôt exist. If it does, it updates
the time the file was last modified, which is its original purpose.

Next, we `chmod +x hello` to make the new file a runnable script.
Another term for this is *executable*. Hence the `x`.

Finally we open the file with the `vi` editor, (which is actually `vim`
but `vi` has been used for more than four decades).

![](/assets/touch-chmod-vi-hello.gif)

After we close the file we can now simply run it. We get into more
about what is in the file, including the shebang line, in the
[Fundamentals in Python](http://pyfun.skilstak.io) course.

### [‚è´ Renaming](#table-of-contents)

For no particular reason let‚Äôs rename the file.

![](/assets/mv-hello-hi.gif)

### [‚è´ Copying](#table-of-contents)

How about a copy?

![](/assets/cp-hi-nyan.gif)

### [‚è´ Removing File](#table-of-contents)

Now we can remove our `hi`.

![](/assets/rm-hi.gif)

### [‚è´ Removing Directory ](#table-of-contents)

Now we can create a directory to put it in, only to delete it.

![](/assets/rm-rf-foo.gif)

***Use this command with extreme caution. Even though we use GitHub to
backup everything this `rm -rf dir` command will not ask. It will
completely destroy the `dir`. If you mistakenly write the wrong `dir`
or dots or worse you will irrecoverably destroy it. There is no
undo! This is why they call it a command line.***

### [‚è´ Editing Existing File](#table-of-contents)

Just point `vi` at the file. 

![](/assets/vi-hello.gif)

Here are the essentials for navigating around and doing things in
`vi`. It takes a bit longer to learn than other editors but the
rewards are well worth it. `vi` is both the most powerful and most
prominent editor ever created. It is literally on every single
Linux/Mac/Unix machine in the world and has been for more than four
decades. **No other editor can make that claim, period.**

![](/assets/vim-essentials.png)

### [‚è´ Save to GitHub](#table-of-contents)

This is all you need to `save` your work for now. This is actually
several `git` commands combined to make it easier to start out.

![](/assets/save.gif)

### [‚è´ Stop the Fish](#table-of-contents)

And before we go. Type `ctrl-c` to stop pretty much *anything*
running on the command line, (although `vi` must be exited properly).
Start the fishes with `fish` and stop them with `ctrl-c`.

![](/assets/fish-ctrl-c.gif)

### [‚è´ Just a Start](#table-of-contents)

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Learning command line will help
you dominate technology and harness its power for you to make amazing
things.

## [‚è´ Understand Basic Algebra Math](#table-of-contents)

Programming is called *Computer Science* or *Software Engineering*
for a reason, there is science and math involved. Programming is
much bigger than knowing where to put the parentheses. It is about
organizing solutions to problems. Finding the best and easiest way to
take the steps to do something. These are skills that math, science,
and engineering address.

### [‚è´ You Can‚Äôt Program Without Math](#table-of-contents)

So, what does this mean for you? It means you have to understand basic
Algebra math before taking Fundamentals. It does not matter how old
you are, only that you can organize basic match functions like this
one:

```
x = (2 x y) + 10
```

Or in computer symbols

```
x = (2*y) + 10
```

Another essential is understanding a grid system, you know, like that
you play with in CodeCombat or Battleship.

This kind of math is essential to even the most basic programming.

### [‚è´ How To Learn](#table-of-contents)

There are a number of resources available online. Each appeals to
people differently depending on their age. Ask your instructor to
help you find one that matches your style.

## [‚è´ Attain the Forest in CodeCombat.com](#table-of-contents)

We have discussed the value of [CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com)
already. Getting into the *Forest* demonstrates that you are familiar
with at least basics enough to move on into *Fundamentals*.

## [‚è´ Configure GitHub Keys](#table-of-contents)

Ok, so this one is likely going to **require some help from your
instructor or teacher assistant**, which is totally ok. It is not
really important that you memorize this, but it does not hurt to
understand what is being setup so you can come back to it
later‚Äîespecially if you would ever like to become a teacher assistant,
instructor, or productive professional developer.

### [‚è´ Secret Decoder Rings](#table-of-contents)

GitHub keys are sort of like a master magic message decoder ring and
a bunch of rings you could give others to communicate with you
secretly. 

![](/assets/ring.jpg)

You can send messages to anyone and they can read it and
know it is from you. Everyone else can be sure the message came from
you and send you secret messages. No one could read each others‚Äô
messages. Communication is just between you and each individual club
member.

### [‚è´ Secure Shell Keys](#table-of-contents)

GitHub uses Secure Shell primarily for keys. There is a ***private***
key and a ***public*** key. You can give the public key to whomever
you want to know that a message is coming from you. The private key
you keep very secret.

In order to not have to use passwords to login to GitHub for every
time we want to save our work we need to give GitHub one of our public
keys. It is a little involved because first we have to make the keys,
but not too hard‚Äîespecially if you have help from your instructor and
teacher assistants. Even though we only have to do this once for your
entire time at SkilStak‚Ñ¢ it is worth understanding what is happening
so you can refer to it later when trying to do it for your own
machines, work computers, or other schools.

### [‚è´ Create a Key Pair with `ssh-keygen`](#table-of-contents)

Enter the `ssh-keygen` command to create a key pair. Just accept
all the defaults by typing enter. (Later you can add a passphrase
if you like when you understand what that means.) The public and
private keys will be created in your `.ssh` directory in your home
directory.

![](/assets/ssh-keygen.gif)

### [‚è´ Copy Your Public Key](#table-of-contents)

You can list your keys with `ls .ssh`. Notice one is `id_rsa.pub`.
That is the public one. We need to copy the content of that key into
the GitHub SSH Keys settings page. To copy first `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub`
to the screen (or use the `pubkey` alias which does the same thing).
Then select it with your mouse and copy it by right-clicking the
selected text or using `‚åò-c` keyboard shortcut.

![](/assets/copy-pubkey.gif)

### [‚è´ Paste Public Key into GitHub Settings](#table-of-contents)

Now we have to give GitHub our public key by adding it to the SSH
section of our *Settings*.

![](/assets/keys-in-github.gif)

### [‚è´ Test](#table-of-contents)

To test attempt to connect to github.com using ssh with `ssh
git@github.com`. You will get a polite denial letting your know there
is no command line access but that you are all set for `git clone`ing
and such.

![](/assets/ghping.gif)

### [‚è´ Clone a Repo](#table-of-contents)

The process of getting a copy of a repo is called *cloning* in `git`
and GitHub. The URL is rather long, but thankfully GitHub makes it
easy to copy so we can paste it into our `git clone` command. If you
add another name after the URL it will create a clone with that name
instead of the one on GitHub. In our case this changes
`pyfun-youraccount` to just `pyfun` (since `youraccount` is rather
redundant).

![](/assets/git-clone.gif)

### [‚è´ Update Push Default](#table-of-contents)

After you have made your changes inside the repo and are ready to save
them for the day you run `save`. However, the first time you do this
`git` needs a bit of information about how to do this. Just cut and
paste the simple like as the default.

![](/assets/pushdefault.gif)

### [‚è´ Update Profile Configuration](#table-of-contents)

Now when you save you will be reminded to set the `user.name` and
`user.email` settings. These are used to give you that coveted green
square credit for your commits.

First make sure you have the right information to put in by going to
your GitHub profile.

![](/assets/github-profile.png)
![](/assets/github-account-name.png)

Now you can enter that information on the command line.

![](/assets/user-name-email.gif)

From now on all your commits will include that information and be
credited correctly.

You are all set.

## [‚è´ Create Your Individual Development Plan (IDP)](#table-of-contents)

After you have decided which [technology path](path.md) you would like
to head down initially you can fill in the details of how you are
going to get there. The fancy name for this plan is an *Individual
Development Plan* or *IDP*. Get used to it because that term will
likely be important to you your entire life as a technologist. Schools
use it. Businesses use it. Entrepreneurs use it. Why? Because having
a plan for what you want to develop about yourself immediately and
over the next year or two is critical to staying motivated and
focused. More importantly, if you do *not* have a plan you are at risk
of just letting your life and career *happen* to you instead of taking
charge of it.

### [‚è´ A Conversation](#table-of-contents)

During class you will be going over these questions and reviewing them
personally to yourself. Then your instructor and TA will talk to you
about them as you come up with them. Think about them well but also
consider what you first reaction is, often it is the best:

* What do I want to make eventually?
* What are my weaknesses?
* What are my strengths?
* How much time outside of class do I have to work on stuff?
* What interests me?
* What would help me get a job I like someday?

As you think about these things capture them by writing them down in
your GitHub Classroom work repo.

### [‚è´ Goals](#table-of-contents)

> You can‚Äôt get anywhere unless you know where you want to go.

Goals guide you. Without them you swerve all over the road. Here are
some things to help you set good ones:

* Is it specific?
* Is it measurable?
* Is it attainable and within my control?
* Is it relevant?
* Is it timed?

### [‚è´ Long Term Vision](#table-of-contents)

Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt know what you want to do or be later, but
start to think about what you enjoy doing every day. What are you good
at *and* what makes you happy? This does not have to be a technical
skill or career path. In fact, for many of you technology will just be
something that enables what you *really* want to do with your life.  

Answer the following question and come back to this over time to
tweak it as you make changes. Be as specific as you can be and don‚Äôt
shy away from stuff that may seem silly. Remember, this is a private
repo that no one but you are your instructor can see. The neat thing
about using GitHub for this is that you can even track the versions
and moments in time when you changed your mind about something:

**What do you want to do with your life?**

### [‚è´ Come Back Often](#table-of-contents)

You will be referring to this IDP a lot over your time here at
SkilStak‚Ñ¢. Make adjustments as you explore and discover new directions
you want to include in your goals.
