# [⏪ Understand Athletic Software Engineering](/README.md)

> Concepts: Repetition

Philip Johnson coined the term [Athletic Software Engineering][]
in 2013 after realizing many of the skills from athletics are not
always considered when learning to program. Indeed, today’s hackathons
and timed interviews where potential employers have you code solutions
sometimes on paper have reminded everyone that programming well
includes programming *quickly*. The less you have to look up, the less
time it takes and the better you have mastered the syntax and
structure of the language.
