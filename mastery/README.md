# [⏪ Learning to Mastery](/README.md)

There is only one way to learn, learn until you master the concept or
technique. Everything else is inferior and will bite you in the rear
eventually. Watch this 10 minute TED talk from Sal Khan from
khanacademy.com as he describes what should be completely obvious to
all of us.

Do you want the doctor that got 94% on his heart surgery exam? No. You
want your doctor to learn it until he easily gets 100%.

## [⏫ You Do Not Progress Until You Know It](#)

At SkilStak™ you simply cannot move on until you have shown to
yourself and others that you have mastered it, period. It is better
for everyone. This means that unlike other schools many will likely
repeat Fundamentals more than once. This is a good thing. It means you
continue to work on it—even repeat it—until you have mastered it.

## [⏫ Speed](#)

One of the signs that you really have mastered something is that you
can do it quickly. These days, with hackathons being used even inside
large companies to find the best programmers, knowing how to code
*quickly* while maintaining *quality* is a big deal. This is why when
you do your exercises you are asked to enter your *Best Time* rather
than just checking it off.
