# [‚è™ Attain 24 Words Per Minute Typing](/README.md)

**Reading is the most important skill of a programmer.** (The next
most important is typing.) Unless you have a physical disability
you must type at least 24 words per minute before moving to
*Fundamentals*. There are many places online to practice, which you
can Google, but the test must be on
[typingtest.com](http://typingtest.com). Record your score in your
workbook including improvements as you make them, (which can actually
be tracked through GitHub).

## Do I have to do home-row typing?

You really should. While I have know typists to get into the 60 wpm
range with just hunting and pecking, those who type in the 90 and
even 100 wpm range always use home row (and, incidentally, have
learned to use `ctrl-[` instead of `ESC` key). Take the time now to
learn it the right way. There is no rush. Invest in yourself and be
patient.
