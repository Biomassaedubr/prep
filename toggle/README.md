# [⏪ Toggle Applications with One Hand](/README.md)

To switch between running applications on *any* modern desktop or
laptop computer press *Command* (⌘) and *Tab*, or ⌘-TAB. Look for
the equivalent key on a Linux or Windows machine, usually *Alt*. This
key can be changed in the System Settings if it is in an inconvenient
place.

When done properly your left hand makes a capital L as you hold down
*Command* and tap *Tab*. When you hold *Command* down you not only
toggle between the last application but can choose from any of the
currently running applications.
